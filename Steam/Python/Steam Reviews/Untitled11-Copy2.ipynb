      "Summary of Reviews:\n",
      "I'm almost done with the game and I feel like I've played it enough to give it a review.\n",
      "There could be more, but the devs said that the story was around 15 hours \"Forspoken's length should take players about 10-15 hours if you are solely focused on the main story, with a completionist playthrough taking closer to 30 to 40 hours to complete.Forspoken's length should take players about 10-15 hours if you are solely focused on the main story, with a completionist playthrough taking closer to 30 to 40 hours to complete.\" - And for the 10 hours thing, halfway through I decided I didn't care for the story and started skipping dialogue, I didn't care for the characters and I got where the story was going pretty quickly so I just didn't watch it and played the game.\n",
      "I enjoy the combat more than anything and just wanted to do some cool moves and fight.Also, I don't like side-quests in games generally, I will try a few if I need to level up more or need some resources, but, again, IN GENERAL, I don't care for side quests, so I opt not to do them if I can help it.\n",
      "As of writing I have put 14 hours into this game.I will say to those genuinely trying to enjoy this game, rush the story as fast as possible and leave your open world exploration for later until you defeat the first human boss and gain new magic abilities.\n",
      "This is when the game truly opens up and gives you new means of traversal and attacks that actually feel good/make sense.The traversal and combat is really the highlight of this game, however that being said...The story is something you'd find on a direct to TV film.\n",
      "It's horrible and I'm not even remotely engaged by it in any way.Frey isn't as bad as some make her out to be, but she can be annoying.Currently the worst thing about the game I find is the repeated audio clips.\n",
      "You can change this in the settings but it's just a sad display, especially for a title priced at $70 USD, and that's the main point of contention here.This game is  worth $70.\n",
      "Breath of the Wild or Fenyx: Immortals Rising are another grand example of how to make a dead world feel alive with rewards based on exploration and that personal touch.None of that is in this game.It is clear to me that they reused many assets from FFXV built a new game on top of it, however didn't ensure the game was up to snuff, therefore has performance issues on PC and PS5.If you are determined to play this game, wait for a deep sale or buy a code from a website.My honest valuation of this game is at about $30, if you can get a half-off sale it would definitely be worth your time then.But $70 is just way too much for such a bare bones open world action \"RPG\" that we see all the time ala Assassin's Creed, and honestly I would rather play an AC game than this.\n",
      "The dialogue is cringe, my PC is more than capable enough to run this game (I have an AMD Ryzen 3900X and a 3080) and it looks terrible graphically.\n",
      "Combat is boring after a while and i feel like this game was extremely rushed.\n",
      "Cringe dialogue, unlikable protagonist, empty copy paste open world, very bad performance, 80€ price tag.\n",
      "i am very disappointed with the game because i had so much hope that it will be good after the first videos and pictures i do not know what happened to the developersare they just lazy or did they run out of budget or did they just overreach themselves in any case the result is not acceptable for this high priceapart from the strong performance problems it is a pure copy and paste game with a boring open world designif you have played the first section about 2 to 3 hours then you have seen basically everything the game has to offercopy and paste NPCscopy and paste MOBscopy and paste bossescopy and paste structurescopy and paste locationsthe dungeon design is a joke 2-3 rooms with mobs and then the bossover and over againthe only good thing is the parkour but that alone can not carry the gamerecommended with 75% discount\n",
      "Very much not worth full price, wait for a 50% or more off sale.My reasons:- This game is poorly optimized, even really good systems struggle to run it smoothly.- Excessively long and numerous load screens.- The main character is very idiotic and belligerent.- The dialogue of (and between) the main character and her magic cuff is horrendously cringy more often than not.- Combat gets annoyingly repetitive very quickly.- Many battles have fixed outcomes, no matter how skilled you are and how thoroughly you mop the floor with certain bosses, if you are supposed to lose, the following cutscene is of you getting manhandled or trashed.- Crafting/Upgrading is largely unrewarding and hardly worth the effort demanded for pitiful returns.- Wild boss (ridiculous damage sponge) encounters demand an absurd amount of skill and preparation, yet the rewards are so underwhelming, they might as well be a slap in the face.\n",
      "When you wander too far off from where the game wants you to be, you are automatically teleported back on to the predetermined path.- Parkour is limited to climbing the occasional low fence, magically dashing a very short distance up walls, and auto hopping very small obsactles in your way (except for when you get stuck on ankle high rubble.)In short, there is none of the following:Assassins Creed style parkour/climbing, Dragon's Dogma style combat i.e. walking on top of/clinging onto a dragon flying/barrel rolling thousands of feet in the air as you attempt to slay it,Dying Light style rapelling/crafting, Breath of The Wild style open world/exploration.Elder Scrolls style magical variety,Bascially any unique/outstanding elements of truly awesome games currently available.To wrap it up, this game is largely very dull and unimaginitive.\n",
      "All the other aspects of the game feels rushed/not finished (VA, cutscenes, graphic related issues, etc) aside from the combat.\n",
      "+First Edit.Nothing like the trailers-Sadly the game is poorly optimized, it is basically a bad port.+I maintain this one, trailers look cleaner and smoother, graphics on this game don't look very \"next gen\" to me.-Graphics are not as great as they show them in the video trailers.+Again they are not, as I said below and before it looks like they were downgraded to match ps5 users.-the way they handle cut scenes disabling your mouse is annoying and cut scenes also stutter a lot.+This is not a technical thing, but is annoying as all hell, there is free roam and \"exploration\", but there are also part of the game where instead of showing you 1 cu scene they play 5 in a row, why?\n",
      "you can achieve the same with just a long one.-The bracelet is the most annoying thing, talks a lot, and I mean A LOT!.+Thanks to the several people comments I turned all the way done this annoying guy, still talks quite a bit but is better now.-they seem to think is a great idea to freeze you in place while the bracelet is saying some stuff that is supposed to be \"meaningful\"+This will keep on happening several times, no way around it.-it is a great idea poorly executed.+The game has some \"unique visuals\" and the parkhour is cool, but that is all, writing is not good sadly, and the story is not bad but is just the way they decided to tell it that doesn't hit you.-NEW THINGS NOTICED--The voice acting is bad, this game have really bad voice acting, there is no feeling from it, the characters feel empty and just there for the sake of an annoying cut scene.-The dips are still there even after updating to the latest nvidia drivers, and even removing RT it does help and you can feel the difference.\n",
      "people joking about the state of it vs cyberpunk and this one being newer, graphics are nowhere near as good, and I can run psycho mode in cyberpunk without a sweat and no dips on 1440p.I am playing on a ryzen 7950x and a RTX 4080, with a 3440x1440 predator g-sync monitor.\n",
      "gives out a vibe of watchdogs 1 when they were releasing the trailers vs the released game.+This one I still maintain is like a watchdogs downgrade, regarding my rig setting, sadly forspoken does not show you your graphics card while in the settings like other games, but you can go to my public screenshots for this game and see the config and how I play it.I would advise not to purchase this game if you want to play the game properly, better wait for it to be polished, because it is a disaster.+Yes the game is not on its best state and I would still say to not buy it if you don't want to deal with the unoptimized mess, there are full gameplays of the game I advise to go look at those during combats like the first one with the dragon and see the graphics, almost all gameplay is from PS5 sadly so mmm is not the same.\n",
      "The problem is very simple: They dare charge 80 bucks for an extremely mediocre and terrible written game which is barely worth 40.I have seen a lot of reviews criticizing the main character Frey and how unlikeable she is.\n",
      "Of the first 71 minutes of \"game time\" most of it has been \"you have to walk really slowly because of <reasons>\" or cutscene.Of the cut scenes, two of them were narratively important.\n",
      "I recommend having next year's gpu which would most likely be a 50 series card instead because even 40 series aren't cutting it.Edit: It's still pretty bad but most of what I said is in the first chapter of the game.\n",
      "Written: 27th Jan 2023Played: 4.6hrs - Yes, I probably should've played more hours to make a more informed review.I would just like to say, that although this may not be a completely fair review (as I have not played for greater than 10hrs), I became so frustrated at the constantly pausing, loading times and frame rate drops that I stopped caring for the story and the characters.\n",
      "The quick and dirty;PROS:1) there are some original ideas 2) Large area to explore 3) I haven’t run into any noticeable bugs4) Cuff’s dialogue is entertaining but repetitive CONS:1) protagonist isn’t remotely likable 2) Very boring side quests (called detours)3) The way cutscenes are used is distracting and jarring.4) graphics feel old, colors are often washed out, resembles a game from 10-15 years ago5) NPC characters are uninteresting, I didn’t care about any of them.6) priced at AAA price but delivers Indy level content.The long version;Forspoken is an expensive disappointment, I’m not sure what they were thinking putting this game out in its current state and at the ridiculous price of $70.\n",
      "It could have been interesting but it wasn’t done well.As others have said, wait until it’s on sale, it’s worth $15-20 for a game to play when you don’t have anything better to do.That’s about all I’ve got to say for now.\n",
      "The writing is so bad that at the beginning of Chapter 10 my jaw dropped because I honestly couldn't believe I was watching Frey, an adult video game protagonist, throw a temper tantrum pity party like a 6 year old child who dropped their ice cream.\n",
      "It's almost worse that some of this game is really good because now I'm going to play the whole thing instead of just giving up like I should.\n",
      "Dont play this game, is definitely not worth its price, its not even worth half the price, dialog are so cringe and the story is so boring, would definitely not recommend it\n",
      "Only good thing about this game is the gameplay and you don’t start having fun till end ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game everything else is ♥♥♥♥ Story: ♥♥♥♥Characters :Frey the most frustrating main character I had to deal with all I wanted was for her to learn the magic ability to Shut the ♥♥♥♥ up Cuff : I actually enjoyed at timesEveryone else suckedBosses was good But don’t buy it don’t fall for the twitter hype if u want the game wait for a huge sale\n",
      "Stop forcing it down my throat and opening it up every time I pick up a paper and/or get to a new place or whatever.- Cut-scene, into Cut-scene, into dialogue that I don't care about because I'm irritated, into Cut-scene, into finally getting to move but very slowly.-* Probably just my computer but about 3 hours in I had to lower the graphics setting a smidge cause my game would crash from spamming the skip through dialogue button.*I think I got it all.\n",
      "Sometimes looks *fine* but not amazing, other times looks like a Sims 2 game.Writing - WOW I don't even know where to begin.\n",
      "such a disappointing game ,overpaid developers pumping out junk,blow that budget on effects and not story idiots, what a waste of money and time,let's hope they don't make a sequel cuz it will be doa....\n",
      "unlikable.World looks so dull and uglyThe parkour is fun but very finickyCombat is mehstory is lamethe entire game feels so uninspired.LOCKING CHARACTER CONTROL DURING CONVERSATIONS SO IM FORCED TO STAND THERE LISTENING INSTEAD OF MOVING TO NEXT LOCATION.All for 105$ MAPLE BUX!Maybe on a DEEP sale but not at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PREMIUM PRICE.\n",
      "Whenever there is dialog you are forced to just stand there and watch, skipping dialog are even worse with the animation jump.It also doesn't help that the game don't run great with the fps drop and other issues.\n",
      "For some reason, Cuff is constantly taking down on you, like dude who are you?The game also lack hit impact and feels floaty at bast.It has great potential for being a good game, but right now it just isn't it.\n",
      "This games is even performs worse than on console, even on quite decent PC (RTX 3080, AMD 3800 and 32GB RAM).Pros:- Main character- Story- ParkourCons:- Stutters are way worse than in Callisto Protocol especially after the cut scenes- Poor optimisation: ~40FPS w/o DLSS and Raytraycing on 3440x1440 and everything is set to High (not Ultra)- Outdated graphics- Wonky camera- Price(?) not sure if that needs to be discussed further onWill update my review once complete the main story, but I would definitely wait for few patches and probably a discount.\n",
      "-ProsCombat flows and is funParkour is pretty damn good once you understand itRich in story elements, lots of loots, feels alot like FFXV.looks like it would be a beautiful game if not for the bad texturesConsthe game has been ported to PC very poorlygraphical glitches and sub par quality even with max specspoor textures make you cringegame was released poorly optimized, but has all the right elements to be a AAA gameWait for some patches to clean this game up to really enjoy it.can't recommend the game in it's current state, but i am gonna continue to enjoy it.\n",
      "I tried my best to enjoy it but having a world you cannot explore for the first 4 hours of game play, being teleported back to the \"bound area\" and overall awful cut scenes, vambrace is the only interesting character and everyone else feels so fake and robotic.\n",
      "Gameplay is ok but it doesn't justify the 90 dollars price point in the Brazil localization.My main gripes are, terrible dialogue, awful main character you really can't care about, 4 hours in and I got a tutorial about side quests?\n",
      "Magic is great, flows great, feels great but its NOT justifiable.Edit:After 6 hours of gameplay MOST of the restraints are removed, Steam refused to refund so I kept playing, dialogue continues to be cringy and the only saving grace of this game continues to be the magic, but your money is much better spent in other games.\n",
      "I feel like waiting to see if Luminous can solve performance issues and bring down requirements before buying is the right decision, atleast on PC.Despite poor performance I like the game so far, I played 5 hours on the trot and the only reason I stopped is due to a crash when opening the map.\n",
      "So it suffices to say that this game does some things right.This game is decent enough but doesn't revolutionise the industry or anything even close to that, so I genuinely cannot understand why requirements are so high for this game.Combat is fluid, parkour is great but kinda repetitive, and enemy design & AI is kinda bland after a while.\n",
      "The lack of melee (atleast where I've reached) is a bit disappointing but I love the spells and magic system so no foul.The landscape while gorgeous at times doesn't feel very atmospheric and is often empty and bland, and sometimes looks downright plasticky.Honestly my modded to hell skyrim (300+ mods) and heavily modded fallout 4 look and handle better, as do Elden Ring and RDR2, Witcher 3 (pre next gen update) too.\n",
      "Are you guys mining bitcoin off my PC??I don't have a problem with story/ game length like other people do but I must say that the writing team should have done a better job.\n",
      "I like Frey but honestly the ♥♥♥♥ she and other characters say kinda feels cringy at times.\n",
      "I like cuff tho, he's cool.I like this game and can't wait to play it properly, so I will definitely change my review to Positive as soon as Luminous come out with performance optimisation patches.\n",
      "I mean despite all the bad reviews i feel like i gave it a 150% and tried to enjoy it but boy does it try even harder to make you hate it.\n",
      "ryzen 7 3700xrtx 307016gb ramm2 ssd samsung 980  pro1440plow settings ,  30 fps in fight , 40 in open worldnice optimization !!!after 3 days.....So it's not because of the game.I found this video.I started to check my pc on different tests and found many errors in my RAM memory.So i think i have problems because of this\n",
      "There's some interesting ideas, like the cat sidequests, but ultimately this is just an excuse to have you walk around a bit before getting a currency for a vendor.It is clear from the very beginning that this game's combat is where all of the effort and creative design went.\n",
      "For a game that's supposedly been in production for years, its offputtingly lackluster especially for a 70$ price tag.Cons:*2 hour long prologue consisting of endless dialog with little to no interaction, but somehow also lacking the vivid cutscenes of games like final fantasy.\n",

      "Cant tell if the game is bad if you don't get to play it for 2 hours!*Movement and combat are both extremely clunky.\n",
      "Which is sad because the enemies look fantastic!I know this seems like a harsh condemnation for a game just released.\n",
      "optimization is an issuethe story isnt anything special i dont care about any of the charactersthe dialogue feels very out of place feeling like a gen z trying to speak to someone at a renaissance fair while even without the optimization issues its a very average game and not worth full price\n",
      "Really, I'd just like to be able to play the game without getting interrupted every 30 seconds.\n",
      "=Pros=-Magic and Parkour look and feel great-Map looks very pretty-Armor looks amazing=Cons=-Optimization is needed-Upgrade system needs reworked cause upgrading armor doesnt feel like it does anything-Dont feel a point of collecting materials at this stage cause its cheap to put upgrades on equipment-Dialogue is way to long and there are gaps in between people talking to each other so they just stand there staring at you-I hated gathering mana around the map so that i could unlock my spells and make them actually do a bit more dmg or do something more-Material chest that you get from completeing a puzzle dont feel that great cause I'm pretty sure i could get them from killing some monsters-Probably more just cant think of them=possible ways to improve the game=-Optimization-Rework Crafting-Revamp Rewards from chest-Rework Upgrading-Faster Dialogue-Dont stop the character to talk to cuff while the npc your suppose to follow keep walking\n",
      "I wasn't expecting to max out graphics with my RX 6600 but I wasn't expecting the game to look as if I'm playing as Mr Magoo and can barely make out the wood texture on the door inches away from young Miss Holland's lovely face.\n",
      "An inordinate amount of your time is spent in banal dialogue with lifeless NPCs, watching in-game cutscenes (that take way too long to load), or otherwise \"stuck\" watching the story get told at you.\n",
      "Beyond the technical sparseness, there is no love or care in creating the world; sidequests are functionally non-existent, monster skins are re-used, PoIs are extremely bland and re-used.I did play through the full game, and I was taking my time and drinking the game in in the early stages.\n",
      "Story's absolute garbage, the main character is the most detestable main char I've played in my 30 years of gaming,  game performs badly even on high end systems, and the open world looks barren and bland.\n",
      "The game play is decent and the main story is passable but everything else is just bad.\n",
      "Lazy copy and paste points of interest, side quests clearly designed to lock you into cutscenes and very long slow walks to pad play time, tons of chest with a single drop you can collect hundreds of just running around.\n",
      "The game really feels like they had huge plans, got about 25% through it and said good enough.\n",
      "This is so weird that you can't move when you're in dialog cutscenes.- The world is quite empty.- The visual isn't as great as in the trailer.If you like fast-pace action game and doesn't care about story at all, this game might be for you but it's not worth the AAA price at $70, $30-$40 at max.\n",
      "Its an attempt though.The graphics (should you have a rig to run this game) are pretty decent but not revolutionary.If you don't have a rig to run this game then don't buy it and here's why:There are game mechanics and abilities that have you move significantly faster than base running speed and allow for really cool dodges and parkour tricks here and there and are open all the time(from my experience thus far) since unlocking.\n",
      "Not to mention everything looks terrible on the lowest settings (it reminds me of assassins creed 2 and other PS3 games of the time tbh)But again this applies if you are an unsuspecting person thinking \" I just barely miss the minimum requirements , if  i run the game on lowest settings I should be fine\"...you wont.On a different note the question of is this game actually worth the price?Well assuming different regional pricing models I cant tell what the game price might be in other countries but where I live this game is a solid 40% more expensive than other AAA games of similar or better quality.\n",
      "This game doesn't really do anything groundbreaking.It is fairly poorly optimised (considering you need like next gen graphics to run  decently)the voice acting actually doesn't sync well (which i find mildly amusing more than annoying tbh)The combat (at least in the beginning, I can not say for further on but I suspect it gets better) is rather lacking.\n",
      "There is no blocking (at least that i discovered) and its mostly ranged attacks that are visually pretty cool but are kind of lacking in most other regards (at least on the hardest difficulty)The concept was an isekai with an African American lady, which was a really cool idea tbh and her story is actually pretty decent (at least I like it but of course preferences differ)But instead of \"That time I was reincarnated in a different world as a powerful warrior with a talking bracelet who just wouldn't stop talking!\"We got\"That time my PC nearly burnt a hole in my wooden desk because the game is too demanding and quite frankly overpriced when it hasn't done anything to deserve it!\"OverallNot a terrible gameGood if you can run itBad if you cantBut wait for a discount.\n",
      "not for $70I dont think the dialog is as bad as people are making it out to be, but its not goodgameplay is kind of fun, but the optimization ruins it, barely getting 60fps with a 3080gonna refund and wait for a few patches that hopefully improve performance and for a price cut, $30-40 feels appropriate\n",
      "ive tried to like this game, ever since last year when i started seeing the trailers and gameplay ive been really hyped but its a let down.\n",
      "Every-time i wanted to get immersed into the gameplay, the characters dialogue would ruin the mood, they would make me cringe, she is like a teenager you meet who thinks they are making a witty remark or come back but you just feel sorry for them.\n",
      "The only good thing about this game is the loadtimes, the (limited) parkour and the way it handles its combat (that breaks when there's more than 2 enemies on the field) Don't waste your money and buy something better like the Dead Space Remake or Hi-Fi Rush.\n",
      "I was really excited to play this game.To jump right to itWhat I Dislike:+ Poorly Optimized (extremely hard to push past 60 fps without good equipment)+ The voice acting and dialogue were atrocious imo    - Had some great one liners and then it started to repeat them like every minute I was done.\n",
      "It felt like no emotion or effort was put into it.+ I played this game on keyboard and the WASD movement felt extremely clunky and not smooth at all (maybe for controller it could differ) otherwise the complaints about controller layout for gameplay (even though you can change bindings) I had no issues with because more buttons = OP+ The Fish Eye Lens of a UI    - Wasn't that bad for like the first 30 minutes but after I was really getting annoyed witht he distorted view and wishing there was a setting to just turn it off.What I Did Like:+ Combat felt fun to me (my opinion) I like it on keyboard and mouse and it felt goodYeah that's it bye.\n",
      "Worth it at 50% off maybe, not a $70 game at all, Voice acting is really bad, story transitions are awful, combat and movement is fun but repetitive.\n",
      "Poorly optimized, cut scenes that make you feel chained up every 4 minutes, story feels like a child wrote it for a school project..\n",
      "Bluey has better storytelling---------------------------------for real though the voice acting, pacing, and opening story line is laughably bad for a $70 price-tagcool combat but only getting 40 fps w/ a 3070 makes even the best part of the game a disappointment.\n",
      "Combat was fine so far but the parkour takes getting use to and feels weird its like an auto parkour system and feels kinda wack at the beginning do to lack of abilities or my own understanding.\n",
      "I got the game for free and its still not worth it.Theres more cutscenes and prompts that take over the game than actual gameplay itself.The movement is horribly done and very buggy and the animations are garbage.Dont waste your time even considering this game.\n",
      "Game makes you FEEL like you got scammed for an unfinished product.\n",
      "Game is unplayable with the stuttering.Outside of the technical issues, the game has too many flaws for a 70 USD price tag.-Long cut scenes with uninspiring dialogue -Combat feels spammy and my literal hand starts to cramp from rapid spamming RT-World is empty and hardly \"open world\"-Barely any side quests-Loot is minimal and unfulfilling Don't think i would play this game even if got it for free to be honest.\n",
      "I have tried several times to play this game, and the only thing that happens is the camera simply spins in a circle (counter-clockwise) over and over and over, and over...\n",
      "The opening cut scene looks about as good as PS3 graphics, the character is instantly not-likable, it won't allow me to connect PS5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X controllers, oh, and did I mention, I can't stop the camera from spinning in a circle...\n",
      "Trying to climb a wall is suffering with the weird kickflips she randomly does.Unlikable+Unintersting NPCs.I would have refunded the game if the intro wasn't so damn slow that I wasted 2 hours just trying to get to the main part of the game.I was really hoping for the story to be interesting enough to compensate but they've completely fail at \"show don't tell\" the lore is pretty much forced on you in the slowest way possible.\n",
      "Ehhh, sure...* Started the game - Cinematic - Thats a lot stereotipical conversation, at least it runs good* Started the actual game - Gameplay - Struggles to get even 30 fps with DLSS on Ultra performance @ 1440pSign me out peeps, this will flop really hard.Refunding it, no questions asked.\n",
      "Hey Square, you should be ashamed, this is just hideous Runing on i7 12700k/3080ti 32gb ram and the game suffer to mantain 50-60fps on ultra on 1440p while still looking like a late ps3 gameRefunded, maybe when it is like 1/3 of the price and more polished, than it will be at least mediocre.\n",
      "The game doesn't forget that Frey is a hood crawler from New York 1 hour after the storyline kicks off; it's fun to see her respond to the \"medieval world\" she was sucked in as someone from our timeline, and also to watch her talking in 'hood' nuances with the Athians' Queen's English.\n",
      "Why does the game start in New York to try and get you to feel for the character the minute she gets in fantasy world?\n",
      "I want eye tracking at all times and I don't want them to look like they're dead-eyed NPCs and oh my god all the NPCs in the game.\n",
      "Boring combat uninteresting environments uninteresting enemies uninteresting dead-eyed NPCs utterly forgettable game and considering this chick went from homeless to fantasy world, I assume she must have at some point in their life.\n",
      "In general this game has a rather average story, filled with stereotypes right from the get-go.Add to that some of the most incessant and annoying voice acting I ever heard and I simply could not bear to continue this game longer than my current hours.\n",
      "An example of this is how the same phrases are repeating between characters so often you might get nightmares about them laterThe movement and combat definitely has potential to be rather fun, but you would have to be willing to ignore poor story and character design.Art wise it is a mix between some beautiful art that crashes headfirst into texture issues and the most glaring ugly extra content I ever saw.\n",
      "I tried playing this game on steam on my PC and i didn't even got 20 FPS on lowest settings 😐\n",
      "Frame rates are all over the place and the graphics in this game look like PS2 or 3 era.\n",
      "I've played for nearly 2 hrs and I feel like I've been in control for 15mins of that.I have already lost interest in the characters and find myself skipping most of the dialogue now.\n",
      "Instead, we’ve been given something boring, that runs terribly on pc and has a story full of overused tropes.P.S. Alice: Madness Returns Is Mutch better than this 2023 game\n",
      "Probably the worst optimazation ive ever experienced on a AAA title, i can barely hit 60 fps with a 6900XT and fsr set on performance mode, I got this game for free and i am still dissapointed and don't even get me started on the horrendous soundtrack, It makes my ears bleed.\n",
      "Honestly if you can catch it for like 30 maybe 40$ it would be a pretty fun game and worth the price.\n",
      "Wait until this game comes down to 20 or 30 dollars I'd say.Running an RTX 3070 Ti at pretty high graphic settings and it's just kind of okay I guess.\n",
      "Go play/replay Hellblade if you want a pretty game with a phenominal story and fun/challenging gameplay.\n",
      "Runs like day 1 Cyberpunk2077 with stunning graphic as good as Eldenring at best.Eveything else, current reviews and in-game benchmark has spoken for me.Edit:I just realized this developer is same as the developer of FFXV.\n",
      "I enjoy it so far except for  the voice acting of the main character, movement is really fun and combat has room to grow that I feel like it could get more fun from here.\n",
      "The game is like still in alpha on almost every level, I tried to give it a real chance, but I feel robbed of money by Square Enix.\n",
      "The game play is fun, but many areas look like unfinished and under populated.\n",
      "What a horrible disappointment...this game looks and plays like it was from 2010 or before.\n",
      "I would not recommend this game.DISPLAY & GRAPHICSHardware Spec:CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3DGPU: AMD 7900 XTX (driver 23.1.1)Display: UW 3840x1600 & 4K 3840x2160Not played on Steam DeckMy SettingsAll settings were set to the highest available apart from ray-tracing as it was too big of a hit for not a lot of quality (was it even on)FSR 2.1 Set to Quality or Balanced during the time playing the game.Average FPS 60-70 on UW, 55-65ish at 4K (pre-patch; Post patch average dropped hard becoming unplayable)The game looks, bland.\n",
      "It's like they looked at games from a decade ago and said \"Yes, the people want beige as a colour palette!\" It's just not visually interesting.\n",
      "The game has crashed multiple times for no real reason as far as I could tell, the stutter is weird because according to AMD's performance monitoring the frame time is fine but I can see the stutter?Overall this needs fixing first before anyone should play it, and it's interesting that the first patch mostly concentrated on the Steam Deck (fixed hardware so I understand, but still odd) GAMEPLAY & STORYThe gameplay is alright, the combat is mostly interesting and the movement mechanics are really fun but it's just not enough to push me through.\n",
      "I just feel like I wasted 6 hours on a bad tech demo.CONCLUSIONI got this game for free thanks to a friend, do not pay for this game.\n",
      "Overall if they fix the performance, issues maybe i could enjoy the story of the game.\n",
      "You can tell a few things about this game:- Yes, is indeed poorly optimized- The stuttering annoying AF even in the cinematic cut-scenes - While the concept of the game is interesting is bad executed - The game usually locks your position and actions during explanations that mostly feels like overplayed Tutorials- Cut scenes are skippable tho - Scenery is great and is gorgeous to look at- Gameplay feels odd and choppy sometimes like rails-driven sometimes in certain scenarios- Parkour should be the best that the game has to offer however for a explore-open world game feels like you're still restricted- Is not that bad however the poor optimization make me quit in just less than an hour- Feels like the early life of Cyberpunk 2077 (technical)- Even that I received it as a redeem code for the GPU purchase is just not worth your time- Maybe could return when an available patch fixes most issues\n",
      "what the ♥♥♥♥ my guy.For nowStory: idk/10 only played for 2 hours before i got pissed with how ♥♥♥♥ game runs and looks.Visuals 4/10 my disfigured dog looks betterControls: 6/10 clanky, feels like im trying to turn a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bus underwater.Combat  8/10 probably the only good thing about this game.Over all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/10.\n",
      "Another hot steamy piece of unoptimized garbo from AAA teams wouldn't buy until they fix the game and make it look like its not from 2005, there's constant screen tearing and its not a great experience.\n",
      "This game is a boring, predictable stupid story of a stupid caricature of what a old white guy would think a black girl is like.\n",
      "(To have any enjoyment i played this game at the lowest possible settings just to have a stable 60 fps, and it still dropped during certain towns and cut scenes)[Running a 3060ti and an AMD Ryzen 7 5800x]I went through this game and explored every single inch of it within 50 hours.\n",
      "I switched it to normal so i wouldn't bore myself but still kept dmg done by enemies to high to at least challenges myself on using my movement abilities to not get hit (which still rarely happened).My Positives:Very unique and engaging combat for the most part (repetitive enemies though)Abilities are unique and flow absolutely amazing togetherMovement also felt smooth (would of had a better experience with a better PC build)This is my first review and I hope my feedback helps anyone looking to buy this game and or try it out.\n",
      "fell disappointed the game , play with 3060 graphic card and 1080p fps still cannot maintain 60 fps.and the price is massive , please fix it.\n",
      "i had 2 hours to really give this game a chance in case i wanted a refund and tbh it was  slow i almost fell a sleep a few times and never got the chance to experience any real game play but after 2 hours of boring unsinkable dialogue and tutorials to me it was not worth the $70 price tag it honestly felt disingenuous of square e nix to drone on the boring tutorial and dialogue and not actually get to the game play ill give the game another chance at some point but when its discounted at 50% or more and id advise anyone looking to buy this do the same use that money for other better quality games that don't try and trap you into a game by extending its tutorial and dialogue for over two hours beyond the opportunity to take advantage of steams policy to decide if you want a refund\n",
      "Voice acting is acceptable but could be better.Combat is ok, but in the first 2 hours you get maybe 2 battles max with sudden cutscenes in the middle of some of the best parts.Graphics are hit or miss.\n",
      "Sometimes I'm getting a solid 110+ FPS on high settings with a 5900x and 6800XT, other times its less than 50 fps and all I did was change the camera angle (when it's possible to actually CHANGE the camera angle).Overall, don't spend $70 on this game.\n",
      "Wait for a sale, or watch a let's play on youtube or twitch and save your money.I'll finish the game and update my review at some point.\n",
      "Game it self is fun just waiting to see what the graphics look like....\n",
      "The reason is simple, a lot of people are saying that it's a bad port, which implies that the game runs better on the \"main\" target platform.\n",
      "I will always take stable 120 FPS over ray-tracing though.On PC, with the above settings, the game looks several times better than the PS5 version.\n",
      "Exception being some of the spells, like \"Cut and Run\", which requires pressing Q + E + 1 (default mappings), it developers a proper claw and is basically unusable, which is sad, considering that it's a fun spell.Obviously, both and PS5 versions are poorly optimized.\n",
      "Even stale bread has more intelligence and personality.So with the annoying main character out of the way, there are the mechanics, constant waiting for dialogue boxes so you can finally move, unresponsive, boring combat.\n",
      "All skills (called magic in the game) look like the same boring things as before, but with minor improvements in damage.\n",
      "Cringe.Eventually it just feels like Bio Mutant, a very big open world, but not very polished because it felt empty and lot of annoying narration with Cuff.\n",
      "I paid so much for this kind of quality of game??Poor character personality progression, poor load time, terrible optimization.\n",
      "The intro sequence felt like a higher quality character running around a ps3 or lower quality world even on higher settings but that might have just been my game glitching as I've seen it look better elsewhere.\n",
      "Even after getting to the main game after 20 mins of skipping all the intro cut-scenes the world was lackluster in appearance on max settings and that's to say nothing about how bad the frame-rate was on any settings.Will most likely refund within a week as even if I can find a performance fix its not going the fix the graphics that look nothing like the trailers or promotional content.OS: Manjaro LinuxKERNEL: 6.1.1-1-MANJAROCPU: Intel Core i9-9900K @ 3.60GHzGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080GPU DRIVER: NVIDIA 525.60.11RAM: 32 GB\n",
      "Given its unfinished state and high price point, it is not recommended to purchase this game at this time.\n",
      "From writing over cutscene staging, game pace, world design to visual design and technical failures not even art students make anymore (star texture visible tiling like its '98) this product is a complete desaster.\n",
      "I tried to give it a fair chance, but eventually dropped it after 20 hours.The story feels bland and predictable, with bad plot points and horrendous dialogue.Even after turning the over-world dialogue off, it was still grating.It also doesn't help they make you stop in your tracks and force you into the dialogue, forget about walking while talking.The tutorial was the first one in years that actually drove me insane.\n",
      "Besides the main story, you'll just be running from the one copy pasted tower design, to the one copy pasted small town design and going through the 1 literal square room building block dungeon for gear.One could argue the world lacks personality because the world is a wasteland, which I find a bad excuse.\n",
      "At least his witty banter was okay.The other NPCs might as well be mannequins, because they look like misshapen plastic, have bad voice acting, and have zero personality whatsoever.The only good thing it has going on is the combat, and even that gets more praise than it should imo.\n",
      "You could technically say the same for souls likes, but in those games you at least have different interesting combat mechanics, have to learn move sets (yours and enemy's) and actually do get rewarded with interesting / useful items and progress.The enemy types don't even matter as much either because there's really just 2 types to be aware of, those that ragdoll (majority) and those that don't.\n",
      "Thumbs up, steam policy!The game looks like it released too early, feeling empty and unfinished.\n",
      "Generic dungeons and boring collection mechanics make this too obvious, in some places it just misses character animations so the screen has to fade to black to cover it and display some arbitary text.Good can be said about the visual effects, combat design and parcouring which feels really crisp.Overall a 5 / 10, would be a 6 / 10 if I could actually play it for more than 15 minutes straight.\n",
      "The story is weak and poorly paced, and the dialogue is absolutely horrific, the main character is especially unbelievable, having a hatred for everybody in the world is not how you write a complex teenage character; the entire script stinks of elderly men in suits trying to guess what they think will sell the most to the 'angsty' crowd.I would not recommend this game.\n",
      "Maybe if the price dropped dramatically then soe people will probably like it purely for the movement mechanics and combat, but if you care at all about story, characters or immersion then I would avoid this game.\n",
      "The spell control system is simple to work and with a little bit of play time I got the hang of it pretty quick.\n",
      "This game makes Ubisoft open worlds look like works of art with just how dead this ones is and that's saying something.\n",
      "The only redeeming thing about this game is the traversal and combat witch needless to say isn't worth the $70 to run and jump through a dead world fighting the same 5 enemy types for however many hours.\n",
      "First of all, the performance is absurdly bad, I have a Ryzen 5 5600X with RTX 3070 TI, 32 GB of RAM, and with this game installed to an SSD, and I can barely get it to run 60 FPS 3440x1440 on high quality with DLSS enabled, most of the time the frame drops really low to 30-40 fps, especially in combat.Second, I hate how the story is being presented.\n",
      "And on top of this, I feel like it's just bad writing.And last thing, the cuff is so f#ckn annoying, and it talks too much.\n",
      "It's one thing that it's a bad port, which is inexcusable by itself at this price point and backed by Square Enix money, but still fixable eventually, it's an entirely different thing that they have not grasped the game design 101 point of not taking away control from the player to shove things in their face.\n",
      "It runs okay during the tutorial but once you hit the actual game world performance really drops.\n",
      "I don't really feel like putting any more effort in the review, they clearly didn't put any into making a game or porting it but found enough money to pay for Denuvo.Edit: I played some more and like it even less now, the open world feels somehow constricted, small, and empty at the same time, which is remarkable.\n",
      "Add to that the bugs, the horrible dialogue (it's not just that one Twitter clip), a boring story, and even the movement mechanics/battle mechanics that are okay at best, and this game just isn't worth the price, especially not at 80 euros...\n",
      "actually good.This game feels like they've made it in 6 months, everything's cobbled together.\n",
      "You're constantly paused during gameplay to read a tutorial or read a transcript or talk to \"Cuff\", facial animations look like PS2 era so none of the characters emote right most of the time outside of cutscenes etc.\n",
      "Maybe i'll buy it again once they fix/patch it up and it's on sale or something, because if you're going to charge a hundred bucks for a game, that comes with certain expectations.\n",
      "Combat felt like a rinse and repeat, has a bland story, and we play as an awful main character.\n",
      "I took my hours into almost complete the game 100% to see by myself why this game is doing all in the wrong way and after some words of Ella I want to tell all the truth of this.The brief is, SE marketing or direction is the worst I have seen in a company in the last decade.I was a Square big fanboy for years, but since FFXV and each game they release I get more and more sad.\n",
      "All the games feels like there is a chaos inside each SE project, they do what ever they want and they dont give a f*ck about the community.I can see in each person rage a past big fanboy of this company that has been abandoned.\n",
      "First of all, the story, you defeated \"two big bosses\" and then you reach the third boss and you find it death, and suddenly a series of scenes and you are in the end of the game, like wtf?\n",
      "The main story probably 6-7h and the rest of the game is a insane big unused open world?\n",
      "Square Enix can make a mediocre game but their OST still being at god level, but god, this is pure trash.The dialogues I dont find it cringe between Frey and Cuff, but FFS, if you make a relation like this, just be sure to introduce hundreds of different dialogs between them, in my 57h I could hear every phrase 500 times, there is no variety.Was after 40h when i told my best friend, another old Square fanboy, this is another game that does not seem to be made by Square, this is not a JRPG, and when I saw the credits, yes, the actors, writers and composers from western.\n",
      "So to watch all the benefits of this world you need certain screens.And yes, in the design part we have amazing japanese designers, and this engine with phew tweaks has the potential to be the engine for Square to make JRPG for the next decade as well this game had all the ingredients to make an epic JRPG but they screwed it up with mediocre western writers, actors and composers.Today I saw that Ella was saying: “I think people always have a positive or negative response to something they’re not used to seeing, and that’s completely okay because that’s the way we incite change.\n",
      "A generic game like most of the mediocre studio with no budget but with a 8h story in an empty open world for 80€?Of course, my message is just to vent myself because nothing will make to change this company that is going in the wrong direction since 5 or 6 years.\n",
      "But I will still waiting here for years no matter what to see again a JRPG from SE that makes me cry like the old FF made, because thats what the real Square fans will do, not the people that bought FF for first time in their lives with FFXV thanks to the crap combat system or Forspoken because no reason and they dont care if SE goes into bankrupcy.The only thing we wanted SE fans from this game...\n",
      "5/10'Forspoken' is a painfully average fantasy open world game that deals with certain issues in terms of mostly the narrative and elements regarding the exploration side of things.\n",
      "The \"open world\" aspect and landscape is cool to look at but feels dull, like there's no life within.\n",
      "The combat is pretty easy in terms of killing enemies and bosses, even playing on the hardest difficulty, leaving little but nothing of a challenge.Overall, this game is just meh.\n",
      "I want to play enough to even give this game's story a proper review but I can't.\n",
      "The game doesn't look even remotely average yet it runs like it's Cyberpunk on launch day.\n",
      "After 7 hours of play its becomes boring to run over the map doing the same quests and listen repeating phrases and dialogues between Frey and Cuff (Vambraaaaace).\n",
      "Idea of universe is good and only Tantas designed well, the rest of the world lifeless and locations or buildings just copied, looks like developers just pressed Ctr C - Ctr V and randomly placed everything in the game.\n",
      "Not even a like because you hate one.I still won't recommend this game to other players if they're expecting usual Square-Enix fare (which is mainly what got me convinced to pre-order).\n",
      "But if you like the feeling of overpowering enemies with a whole arsenal of magic at your disposal (and you don't mind grinding for a bit to upgrade), then this might just be the game for you.\n",
      "Graphic in some regions ok, in some the game looks like its 6 Years+ old.Dialogue ranges from cringy to downright unbearable.\n",
      "Especially first 2 hours are insufferable.Side Quest are designed super dumb, boring and bland.Quest and Interactions with NPC in the main City (the only city) are annoying as hell.Voice Acting ranges from mediocre to totally unfitting and unpleasant.Sound Design isn't very good.all in all very underwhelming, especially for the high retail price.Menus are partly impractical.\n",
      "Running animations are just as bad....They have to make some MAJOR fixes before I'd play this game...\n",
      "Story 0/10combat 8/10movement 7/10overall 2/10The game play is relatively fun , but when you are forced to the city to carry out a bunch of boring conversations that take 1-2 hours its just not worth it.\n",
      "Games released in 2010 have better graphics and it's not due to the need of giving them some time to load, they're just ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n",
      "Most of the time in game feels like is spent looking around because your movement is blocked :/ At points the game forces you to rush the main story and it's not helping itself much because the main story is super short.\n",
      "The game is poorly balanced, side bosses found when exploring the map are more challenging than the main story end game boss, it's like a joke.\n",
      "Many graphical issues and poor design choices like tons of invisible walls making you detour to get to easily accessible locations and textures appearing and disappearing during cutscenes even.After you finish the main story During a cutscene that took part in the final boss fight the main character's skin tone changes from black to white.\n",
      "OK this game is more punishing the cyberpunk and can't be run max WITH DLSS ON on even a 4090 (struggling to get 40FPS in pretty empty areas with so much fog I almost can't see anything to walk around.Does appear to suffer from huge slow down once its been running for a couple of hours.I think this has to get a don't recommend from me right now.\n",
      "Tutorial: The game...2 hours worth of cutscenes with almost no gameplay to decide if you'll actually like it or not, and doesn't run well on PC, not to mention the story kind of just throw words and lore at you like its supposed to mean something, but it just doesn't...\n",
      "A lot of the other reviews are going to talk about politics, or performance, or pricing, or \"wokeness\", but my negative review comes entirely from the perspective of a Steam Deck owner and Linux gamer whose been screwed over by Denuvo this time.The devs here clearly wanted to support the Steam Deck, but the way Denuvo is implemented in Forspoken was causing them some serious trouble getting it to run there.\n",
      "You might also need \"-noDirectStorage\" to get it to work.Of course, running it that way also creates a problem if you're NOT using Proton Hotfix; the game decides you're trying to pirate it (despite the premium-priced $70 investment!!!!) and Denuvo locks you out.\n",
      "And Square, don't play stupid games like this and be upfront about Denuvo if you expect people to pay a premium.\n",
      "Movie is playing and then for no reason at all the game director thought it a good idea to have you walk 4 feet and click a thing only to start to next one.\n",
      "The long introductory / tutorial section of the game will ensure that if, like me, you want to experience the actual gameplay before simply asking for a refund, it will have been too late to do so (by Steam's refund policy standards) by the time you realize the game is broken and nothing like you expected and were promised.\n",
      "I'm usually very open and understanding, especially with games that have just been released, but this just feels like a scam.\n",
      "Positive:- graphics are okay, not great but it's not too bad- very nice and interesting fighting and parkour system with great animation- the lore is pretty good- you can pet catsNegative:- Lots of bugs-  one cutscene after another-  kind of unlikeable maincharacter- world feels empty- dialouge and plot are predictable- most npc-ish NPCs I've seen in a long time- fights are repetitive and boring- bosses dont have interesting attack patterns- 'hard mode' isnt really hard it's just boring beause it takes forever to do kill anything- freys voice lines are often out of line and weird- it feels like the game is unfinished - definitely not worth 80€, maybe 15-20€\n",
      "Especially when they also just smash you with the obvious \"character states name during power boost\" shenanigans and again in the ending but with all the subtlety of a punch to the face and without any of the charisma, charm, or actual payoff of something like the Princess Bride.2/10The game is pretty but the colors and oversaturation of brown/gold towards the final acts is a visual disaster.\n",
      "It's the only thing about the game that was legitimately pleasurable to engage in, and if this wasn't a AAA game with AAA game development time and advertising I'd believe it if somebody told me this game was an experiment to see if great gameplay can carry a game if everything else about it is subpar.[b/]Conclusion[/b]70 bucks for about 20 hours of story isn't it chief.\n",
      "I've played around 4 Chapters so here's my thoughts: Performance:- Had issues at the beginning where the frame rate would just go to hell in cutscenes and in gameplay- Switched from the default preset to highest available after the NYC area and I didn't notice any chances, really.\n",
      "- Some clear lighting issues going on- I can't put my finger on it, if it's a lack of or an abundance of post processing, everything looks \"eh'Gameplay : - Maybe I'm spoiled, but I expect a base QoL & standard from any triple AAA title in 2023: i want to move while talking to my stuck-to-me companion, i don't want a cutscene for every line of dialogue/reaction/2m of walking distance, I don't want to press 4 to 5 buttons so I can \"dodge\" while also targeting an enemy and moving the camera and choosing a direction- This is subjective, but the combat system just isn't for me.\n",
      "It feels like there was supposed to be more content that got cut before release hence you'll get a cutscene where a little girl offers to show you the way out of the city, followed by some misc learning to craft stuff, followed by the little girl drawing on the ground and YOU reminding her that she was supposed to guide you.\n",
      "So, let me just start and explain why I said I do not recommend this game: It's expensive for the state of the game right now and it's a price range that no videogame should reach (normal or Deluxe versions).Pro:Sound: amazingGameplay: it's very, very good, especially the Parkour.RPG progression is very good also.Cons:Story and Dialogue: well, I don't know what happened here but, the game has the worst dialogues I've seen in a videogame (won't disect this point).\n",
      "The 5minutes of Combat you have during the first hour of this game, just feels extremly boring and not challenging at allgot this game for free and still want to refund it\n",
      "But it's more like inFamous game from PS3, rather than something new and technically cool.Main problems are optimization and specifically RTX:\\1) With current shading/lighting model in game there is literally no point in enabling RTX features, but they taking about 30-40% of your's PC performance.2) Shading/lighting model comes straight from 2012-2014 games.\n",
      "Check Digital Foundry video, for in-depth explanation.Fighting system kinda cool, I guess, but I'm played only with one magic tree (judging by trailers).Movement: cool fluid animations, but it has same problems like inFamous games, sometimes you can overshot buildings/obstacles, which can be irritating.Particles are the main selling point of this game (that's what trailers sells you), and this also problem of the game, rendering tech under the hood, just doesn't allow to handle all this with flawless execution.\n",
      "It's like I'm playing in Debug version of the game, when super high-intense scenes are on screen.Dialog system: just don't, don't ever do such system ever again, faiding between dialog instances, player locked in-place, when talking to cuff (oh, sorry vambrace).\n",
      "It's hard to see thing even for non Deutan/Protan player, imagine how bad this is for colorblind people.Overall: this game desperate for additional 3-6 of good optimization and development.\n",
      "I'd wait for a deep sale - like £15 should do the trick (for a £15 game its good i guess?) Anything more than £30 you're getting scammed.\n",
      "Firstly, I got this game for free with my RX 6750 XT GPU from AMDSecondly, this is the worst game that I never spent any money onThirdly, you mean if I buy the Deluxe Edition I get access to a prequel story with no release date and a mini digital art and soundtrack?\n",
      "So, you are going to give me a full soundtrack and artbook later when you actually finish the game?Game is poorly optimized, looks nothing close to the trailers, and you can almost become a 100% completionist in around 15 hoursAnimations are not good, story is not good, voice acting is not good, and what is with the excessive cursing that just gets completely old within the first 5 minutes?\n",
      "How do I refund a free game?It feels like a job simulator with way to many cutscenes and way to little actual gameplay.\n",
      "I will list the goods and bads below so you can decide for yourself.Pros:-Easy game play, difficulty can be scaled-Comical dynamics between characters-Skill points to openly decide what you want to levelCons:-Optimized terribly, fighting to get anything above 60 at 1440-Dated graphics, besides ray tracing its hard to tell this is a game that was released today on PC.-Minimum spec requirements are ridiculous, half my friends wouldn't be able to play.\n",
      "I can't speak for the PS5 side of the house but the PC side is almost unbearable.Even if you think this game looks interesting I highly recommend you give it some time to get fixed.\n",
      "Story will take you ~15-20 hours WITH exploration of some of the desolate world, Combat is very fun once you get your move sets unlocked but unfortunately just as it starts to get good you're already near the end.\n",
      "initially got the game free when i got my RX 6800 XT, was glad to finally be able to play it today, only to be greeted with some pretty bad audio issues, which a few have already started to be noted online by reviewers, the audio issues apparently are not fixed by downgrading your sample rate from 32b192khz to 24bit48khz...only way to do it is to go from 5.1 to 2.1, which is an absolute joke....i am wanting to like this game, but this audio issue....the buzzing everytime something or someone talks or music plays, it just a static buzzing kid of sound which is annoying AF, and makes the high pitch shouting of an impatient mother sound like bliss!if the issues get fixed, then i may consider updating this review\n",
      "main story is way too short (and it actually is just really bad)side quests are so boring and effectively \"fetch this and bring it back\" or \"follow me and wow you found an item!!!!!!\"combat and movement is fun hard = more health and is barely a challenge (think i died like 5 times through the whole run)as much as i enjoyed the combat and movement, it isn't enough to rec this game, especially at the current pricewait for 50% off minimum for this (and even then basically everything is relatively shallow so probs not even worth it at that price point)\n",
      "This game has it all weak gameplay, lame fights, super depressing setting, bad story telling and the list goes on.\n",
      "Very predictable, characters are just badly written😕overall pretty disappointed as i was REALLY hooked in the game for the first couple of hours and then after that, it just started going down hill story wise.Also feels like you could finish the game in 5 hours, if you don't do any bonus missions or go around.Parkour is really fun and skills are amazing too, but i don't think it's worth to pay THAT much for a game like this...\n",
      "Sloppy storytelling, uninspired world-building, characters who are actively unlikable (or actively contradicting themselves from scene to scene), and game play that holds the player's hand instead of being engaging or challenging.\n",
      "so where to begin,the game play itself is pretty reasonable so its a game you can have differing levels of enjoyment so it is not a love or hate game, HOWEVER, the cinematic are far to frequent and long with poorly constructed and executed dialog with animations that take me back to dragons dogma.\n",
      "its not worth it.remember how cyberpunk 2077 was not rendering textures fast enough etc, imagine that and playing with a new combat system that isnt perfect but is by no means bad, in a world with dragons dogma textures and you are there.\n",
      "poor graphics, loads take forever, combat mechanics could be better.There is a lot of cut scenes every 5 min, it gets annoying\n",
      "The promise of a high-end, graphical, realistic game made by a AAA developer, featuring a spunky, female POC protagonist, had me excited to dive into the world Square Enix had created.\n",
      "However, upon playing the game, it became clear that while the game featured a vast map and decent graphics, the story and gameplay fell short of many of my expectations.\n",
      "The world-building and rewards for exploration were underwhelming, the story was dull and cringe-worthy, the MC and dialogue was horrendous, and the traversal and combat mechanics, even if fairly fun, were clunky and jarring.\n",
      "The combat, magic, and other areas of the game are visually stunning, but ultimately fall short of a cohesive Next Gen appeal that the marketing materials implied.Worldbuilding - 9/10 - The map is pretty big, I'd wager to say it's about on par with HZD in size; there's plenty of notes and books and things to read and learn to deepen your understanding of the world and it's lore.\n",
      "Not much to say here, the world building felt pretty solid, the only thing that knocked a point off for me was the cringey and unrealistic commentary that starkly contrasted with the tone in the menus.Traversal - 6/10 - The game's movement mechanics are pretty fun, but alas, the parkour abilities are unfortunately hampered by invisible walls and other restrictive elements in cities.\n",
      "Overall, it feels like Square Enix was trying to mix Witcher 3, PS4 Spider-man, Dark Souls, and Horizon Zero Dawn combat systems, but fails to implement them in a cohesive way, leaving you with a decently fun but not overly enjoyable combat system.Story - 3/10 -  The story in this game is an utter failure, with cringey dialogue, nonsensical character traits, an overly mean and un-relatable main character, missed story beats, mis-paced, and overall destruction of the suspension of disbelief.\n",
      "I wish I could get a refund but am too far outside the 2 hour game play time to qualify.Overall Score - 5/10 - fun to play overall, but the story and other negative points make this game very boring, un-intuitive and nauseatingly cringey.\n",
      "I bought this game because I loved the combat but even after investing several hours into it it's just not even close to the quality I would expect from such an expensive game...Graphically it looks worse than most other triple A games on my rig (I dont have a setup for ultra settings but why are especially the textures so much worse than other games with the same hardware?)The characters and story are interesting only at the first glance but become boring and annoying REALLY fast.The animations - as great as they are during Parkour and Combat - are sub-standard for Mimic and during NPC interactions.The world is not really open because there are always high walls around every new area you visit.\n",
      "It's not really interesting enough for the amount of stuff (chests, challenges, etc.) it wants you to visit.Most Quests I played (relatively small sample, see above) were REALLY boring and I mostly asked myself WHY THE HELL I would even do something like this if not for completions sake...All in all I really really wanted to love this game but I am very disappointed with the full package even after playing the demo - For anyone interested in the game I would recommend playing the free demo 3 times in succession and the thinking about it again.\n",
      "if it wasnt for the action i would have quit the game long ago but i dont recomend it main charackter is anoying the cutscenes and dialouge is bad open world is fine but feels colorless sometimes bosses are ok but the preformance is bad even with optimisation\n",
      "The story and characters are mediocre at best and certainly don't get better as you continue to play, and the side quests are just interruptions of gameplay or uninspired fetch quests.The combat is fun but you have to go out of your way to make it fun by increasing the difficulty and purposefully using different combinations of spells instead of just spamming a single ranged attack.Overall unless you have nothing else better to play or are really into the Ubisoft style of open world I would skip this especially at its current price or wait for a heavy discount.\n",
      "Finally the accessibility options are very good - they have built in \"God\" mode in them, you can turn the difficulty down even more by making Frey auto-dodge, lower damage to nothing or next to nothing and effectively increase your damage by making your enemies stagger or stay down moreThe problems with this game are much deeper than the trailers would suggest.\n",
      "But once you get to chapter 4 I think it was where the world really opens up it absolutely drags and shows its flaws.Without going into spoilers, and boy would I love to, both the characters and story are some of the worst told I have ever seen in any medium.\n",
      "As you expect at the 11th hour she has a change of heart and it feels absolutely terrible - it's preceded by nearly a 30-45 minute section of on-camera character exposition recounting the whole story to the character/player before the game even started.\n",
      "This is one of the poorest ways to tell a story mechanically.The game play starting chapter 4 is a huge open barren world which I hope leads to the death of the \"open world\" genre, at least of this quality.\n",
      "In addition the world is littered with nearly a dozen types of resources all of which can be upgraded, refined, into newer/better resources for your crafting.One of the most infuriating things in the whole game are these non-stop tutorial-like popups.\n",
      "They got so bad I was not able to contain my anger, I would scream - \"Just let me play!\"  I have no idea who thought every one of these pop ups for the whole game for everything you could think of was a good idea in the final release - one of the worst technical decisions I have ever seen in my entire gaming life.The combat, the meat and potatoes of the game is just not well done.\n",
      "Playing this game for what it appears to want to be, an open world third-person action/combat game will just give you fatigue.During the writing of this review of the game I went back and forth whether I would give this a thumbs up or thumbs down - I know I wrote a lot of bad but there are good bones on this game, but not many good bones.\n",
      "this game would have been 10 times better if the main character was mute like Link from Zelda.\n",
      "IMOstory: 2/10 (the main character just makes you cringe every time she opens her mouth) characters: 2/10graphics: 8-9/10combat: 5-7/10 (i raise it from a 5 to a 7 because in late game you find some really fun magic but at that point the game doesn't have much left)overall opinion, dont purchase this game until it's at least down to 30$, theres ''a lot'' to do (not really) you can honestly clear the map in under 24 game play hours if you wanted too, i played 15th in total and did everything on the 1st and most of the second region.\n",
      "All special places are located on your map, so exploration ist rather feeling a grind than satisfying.I like the main character and the concept of obviously more female oriented themes (nail designs, cats, etc.).\n",
      "And I don't think, that any patch would help.So after 20 hours of game play, I decide to stop.\n",
      "Constant crashing, frame-rate stuttering, the map screen has to load in when selected, takes 4-5 seconds for it to actually appear, the loading times are bad, I can't even complete the benchmark and the game crashes, ignoring these issues the game is kinda fun, definitely not worth the almost 100.00$CAD that they are charging for, and for reference if your thinking I'm playing this on a potato machine my specs are as followed:GPU: RTX 3080tiCPU: i9 10850k OC 5.1 GHzRAM: 32GB DDR4 3200OS: Win 10For the specs of my machine and using standard/high settings on the game, I didn't touch any of the ultra settings this is a big disappointment.\n",
      "And this is in no way a \"review bomb\" the game is just that bad right now, It has nothing to do with the story content, though that also so far leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion.\n",
      "i mean my hardware may not be the latest in greatest but its darn good , but with the being said I am currently run an rtx3070 overclocked with 100mem and 200core normal , with an AMD ryzen 3700x overclocked to 4.05ghz in this game will not run well on standard with with the frame drops and the graphics taking a hit .BUT when the game runs good at times the game looks great .\n",
      "Hopeful they release and update that fixes some of the performance issues that the game is having that way it will be more enjoyable than it is now cause when frame rate drops from 72,to 63 and down to 25 it can be come a problem when trying to traverse the land.The story is very slow at the begging of the game and picks up after you have played for an few hours .I will agree that some of the people you encounter along the way you kinda forget before they can make an real impression on you .\n",
      "There are some other game modes that are a nice change like time attack trails and defeat this boss before the time limit runs out .\n",
      "Combat: 9/10 was fun.Story: 2/10 It couldnt get me invested enough to care.Characters: 2/10 No one really stood out.World: 5/10 In an mmo it could almost count as a pass, with one central hub and other big areas u grind and kill mobs.Performance: 0/10 My rig has a 5800x3D paired with 4080 and 32gb ram.\n",
      "No game should run like this with that level of hardware, and I've heard the ps5 version isn't too great either.Hard pass unless you only care about the combat, and if you're deadset on getting the game, at least wait for a sale...\n",
      "This would be fine if this was a point and click game but with the promise of action or exploration, it was incredibly frustrating.- If another unnecessary cut scene is not being forced down your throat, then you have to slowly escort someone without being able to perform any actions, other than to walk slowly and listen.\n",
      "Maybe you should tell me in detail?!?- The story centres around a POC protagonist and apparently there wasn't a single POC in the writing team which at this point feels like it should have required effort to achieve!\n",
      "Poor performance.Open World is massive but has absolutely nothing interesting in it.Enemies have very limited/repetitive movesetsThe main character is extremely aggravatingVery low amount of contextual/random voice lines, for instance when scanning the area you will hear the same 5-8 voice lines repeated for the 100+ times you use it.Graphically the game is fine, aesthetically though for a fantasy world it is very bland compared to standouts like Elden Ring/BOTW and even the Horizon games.For some reason the game chops up cutscenes into 50 different mini-cutscenes separated by a black screen, it's horrendous.\n",
      "(Fed the sheep)Main story is extremely short (~9-10 hours if you choose to ignore optional content) and gives you no reason to visit more than 15-20% of the world (not that there's anything of note to find anyway)No memorable musicThe only positives I have to say is that one of the supporting characters is very occasionally funny and the Magic feels weighty, is satisfying to use and is visually excellent.\n",
      "So, unlike many I've actually beat the game so hear me out...I feel like if you took Infamous Second Son, Horizon, Assassin’s Creed, Lord of the Rings, and mashed them altogether, you get a pretty fair idea of what they’re going for here.\n",
      "Pros:- Combat is fun.Cons:- Optimisation- Story- VA- Everything elseNot worth full price as it stands.If you do buy it, I hope you like cut-scenes and walking only 10 paces at a time.\n",
      "There is a lot of hitching/ skipping when cut scenes are playing (and it seems like that's all the first hour of the game is).Too much hand holding and no option to turn off pop up hints (even if you select the difficulty indicating that you know how to play action games).\n",
      "I'm truly upset, and I normally like to give games a chance.I might even quit drinking and start going to bed at a reasonable time.\n",
      "Cool spells take too long to get to after walking around for an hour before getting to actually play the game.\n",
      "Really want to like this game but I cannot recommend it in its current state.-Graphically, looks stunning but at the expense of the system requirements.\n",
      "Needs more optimisations.-Only played the first 2 chapters and the story so far is alright but was frustrating at times to watch (definitely does not give the vibe of a street smart character).\n",
      "-The pacing in the first chapter felt horrendous (would be better for pacing if the whole chapter was an intro scene).-The combat feels good, but would recommend a controller with paddle sticks or you need to learn the way of the claw.-The stopping for a chat with Cuff (really?\n",
      "SE, when you charge people buying a game for a price no one else dares to set before within the industry, you better be as good as an alien technology could do.\n",
      "Or you will see this coming naturally.I didn’t play this game for long, not only because it didn’t make out alive for the 2 hours expectation test, but also I don’t want missing the refund insurance I have when purchased games from Steam.\n",
      "The difference is: if Square made a film star venture into Athia, we kept Ella’s stunning looking as Fray, Forspoken would have one less issue to talk about here.Gameplay Mechanics Despite I couldn’t go too far off in the game, but the combat honestly in my opinion, seems won’t last being interesting for long.\n",
      "Over and over and over again it's the same dialogue between the two of them.The combat is a joke, the automatic dodging makes it trivial, choosing the difficulty ONLY INCREASES HEALTHPOOLS, no extra mechanics or anything, it makes an already tedious 5min fight into a 15-20min fight for no reason at all.The parkour is definitely not finished, it doesn't work everywhere, it's very clunky and doesn't feel smooth at all, it's only been made worse by the massive amount of cutscenes and interactions that force you to either stay still or make you not able to move around your camera.The world is very boring, a few mobs here and there, just a vast wasteland of nothingness.My final take is, this game is nothing like the trailers or previews they showed, it's not finished, not even close to being finished.\n",
      "Summary of why this game is bad and you shouldn't be playing it, based on my first impression:- Expensive- Cringey lines- Unpolished in almost every aspect (I got a 3090 and I can only get ~60-80 fps maxed out settings @ 1080p with DLSS, even DL2 isn't this bad while also looking better and having more things going on than this game)- A lot of the game features felt unfinished (it feels like comparing the Cinematic Justice League vs Snyder cut, that's the best comparison I could come up with, this game feels like something that should've had more, yet someone on the company was like \"that's too long, make it shorter and more compact, cut this and that out, change that to this, etc\")- Did I mention that it cost a lot?- Some unseemingly bad game/story design (imo)- Bad facial animation (it looks really jarring in at least like 1/3 of the scenes I've seen)- Bad voice acting in some parts (a lot of tone miss / monotones in the wrong time)- Awkward silences every now and then, it's like I'm watching a skyrim conversation for a sec...- PriceSimple example of why it's bad:The first 1.5h or so, are basically interactive cutscenes, the amount of time this game stops you and show you an uncontrollable scene is astonishing, you watch minutes of cutscenes, walk couple steps, or run a block or two, and then met with another cutscenes, maybe even accompanied with a loading screen, rinse and repeat...\n",
      "chopped into bits and pieces here and there due to the innumerable amount of cutscenes?the magic combat was good, nothing amazing (at least on my experience, i didn't play much to unlock everything after all), the animation transition, especially from Flow to opening doors / chests are really jarring, it's like they're trying to copy Witcher 3 ballet-like movement principle (how Geralt's combat animation was based on dancing) on it, when you press the interact button the character would loop to the door and then loop the other way to kick the stuff open, which is...\n",
      "- Parkour is fun and flashy but can be annoying at times.- Cuff is actually a good character.\n",
      "So far he is not very dynamic and his relationship with Frey doesn't seem too complex but I'm sure that will change further along into the story.The bad:- The flow of the game is heavily disrupted by awkward cut scenes and terrible dialogue.\n",
      "For example, at the start of the game, you first speak to the council of Tantas, there are like 4 different cut scenes that are spliced into one.\n",
      "This doesn't seem like its much of an issue for the rest of the game but the first few hours feel very awkward with how the cut scenes flow.\n",
      "The movement was pretty fluid throughout most of the world and had a lot of potential I thought when initially looking at the game that I was excited to play well before it was even wishlist-able.\n",
      "I played the game and did a lot of my time in the first handful of chapters where I would do as much side content I could in each area before continuing on with the story.\n",
      "Worth a playthrough via a monthly free-2-play service like game pass but worth closer to $30 than $70 (or more if you went the deluxe route like I did).Combat: B//Story: B-//Main char: C//Side char: B-//Overall Score: 5.5 out of 10.\n",
      "This game at least feels unique in its own take.I think this game will be good with time, especially if the modding scene takes off.\n",
      "Game could be fun if it stopped locking me in place every 25 seconds for a tutorial or a piece of dialogue, but I didn't want to risk going past the 2 hour time limit before I could return it.Maybe I'll get it on sale in the future.Also, with things like Cyberpunk 2077, why are we pushing out games that look like they came out in 2006?\n",
      "I've seen far better looking games than this running at 100+ fps.\n",
      "But when you actually sit and play the game everything becomes apparent that the developers had multiple teams working on this game and not a single one of them spoke to each other.Gameplay - Parkour looks fun and the combat looks fun.\n",
      "When you are running around the environment you cannot control the camera, control your character, AND use the scan button at the game time.\n",
      "So you can move, control camera, and scan to your hearts content without doing crab claw.)Dialogue/Character - Frey is one of the most unlikable protagonists I have ever played as in a video game.\n",
      "The game itself frustrated me to no end and I just couldn't keep playing.I absolutely cannot recommend this game unless you are prepared for just an overall mediocre experience that in my opinion isn't worth the investment.\n",
      "Edit: finally completed the game, and it is an absolutely \"not recommended\" title for me...Let's talk about the good things:+ Graphics performance is smooth for me (3080TI, i9-9900k, 4k, 60fps limit, DLSS)+ Visuals range from \"really amazing\" in many places to \"mediocre\"+ Traversal is fun+ Soundtrack is not badBut there are a lot of things I just don't like:- Main character is bland, boring, doesn't understand (want to understand?) the sh*t she is in and not accepting she's in a different world and culture- Terrible pacing for the first hours and First Time User Experience- Awful delays in movement and combat due to awful pop-ups that require waiting time and a button press, and then still a delay before the action resumes- In-game cutscenes back into action result in 2-4 seconds of waiting time until the character moves (this is also the case on PS5, and seems to have been a game design decision).- Main Character and Vambrace just don't 'hit it off' in the sense of dialogue feeling anything but in-studio-recorded instead of relaying to what is happening on screen / in the game at that moment (e.g. running away from a dragon, you'd expect some heightened voices, maybe heavy breathing due to exertion --- none of that).\n",
      "It crashed on start up the first few times I attempted to play it, finally got it to run past the loading screen, and now it's starting to crash during fights.\n",
      "The game is unique and I really wanted to try and like it despite the mixed reviews when they released the demo.\n",
      "The concept is gold and is exactly what I want to see from games, but this was sadly a very poorly executed title.I think the VFX artists, combat designers, and animators did a great job.\n",
      "If you wish to play this game for gameplay alone tread carefully and wait for a sale do not buy this at base price, do not buy the deluxe edition and please buy something better than this.\n",
      "2. STORY \tBefore beginning this topic, I do not like how Frey cares little about Athia and how she treats everyone around, her not caring for the people of Athia is very annoying and not a captive trait for people playing if you care for the story and since I do it takes me out completely even though she \"redeems\" herslef at the end but no, she should have had a better emotional arc then just wanting to go home because \"wah i miss my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ life even though i have these amazing powers and everyone needs me to save OUR world\".\n",
      "Then throughout the whole game it is constant horrible dialogue, lack luster emotional scenes and jarring cut to black moments going back into a cutscene for no damn reason.\n",
      "Your first purple magic is earth so the thump of small and huge rocks hitting creatures makes a nice impact, your second element is fire and the roaring flames and slicing through the flesh of your enemies is beautiful, the water element is lack luster when Frey uses it but Prav made it look cool, and well the sound of certain affects for the water like the waves and suction special had amazing sound when the enemies would get pushed back or sucked in, lastly is...well idk what element really this was but sadly I barely used it so I can't say much on the matter of effects it did and how good it could have been.\n",
      "The combat is interesting, but the game, even in the first hour and a half, makes it clear that the story is far, far too cliché and typical.\n",
      "--> poorly optimized console port- framerate on high settings is poor (Ryzen 9 3950X, 64GB RAM, RTX2080Ti, installed on SSD)- on high settings textures, especially indoors, are still looking poor (at best)--> who wrote those dialogs??- storyline is utterly cringeworthy- that bracelet is annoying af- the protagonist is temper tantrum on legs that is age 20 on paper only apparently--> cutscenes are the endboss- the constant loading of needless transition scenes that cannot be skipped and take away any control is more frustrating than a soulslike-boss- a lot of loading in between, A LOT- did I mention that a lot, sorry...\n",
      "A LOT of these scenes are USELESS?--> lackluster audiodesign- starting from the very first minute, ambient music is either entirely missing or becoming monotone rather quickly- ambient sounds (i.e. chatter in the city/bar) lackluster as well, which brings me to...--> open world feeling lifeless- city feels empty and void, lack of detail and interaction- outside world seems same old, same old rather quickly, with as many vertically seperated plateaus as possible to make your fingers cramp from hitting jump/double-jump buttons like a monkey- enemy variety not impressive so far, encountered the same three basetypes over and over after 4 hours of gameplayYes, correct, a review after only four hours of gametime.Becaused it feels frustrating.Frustrating to have paid yet again for some unfinished feeling garbage that feels dull very quickly.Frustrating because the price tag on this one tries to set a new standard, whereas the gameplay certainly does not.Four hours, after which I feel like uninstalling and moving on.So, hell no, cannot recommend at all.Better play Elden Ring, less frustrating than this jumping simulator and the game world feels alive while looking breathtakingly beautiful.\n",
      "Sad that the developers can't even acknowledge this issue.So after playing the game the story starts out strong and fun.\n",
      "Combat it alright but at times I feel my character doesn't respond like they should for example my movement isn't registered and the character gets hit.The dialog especially during the early game freeze the players movement.\n",
      "Yes, in 2023 you will play a game where the main character keep repeating the same phrase or asking the same question just to listen to the same answer, and it will happen a lot.\n",
      "I don't even care if Frey looks good or bad because the cloak, necklace and nails, because changing feels more like playing with a doll than upgrading a game character.How I wish I could go back in time, slap myself in the face and say to me:  \"don't give more time to this game, don't think it will get better, the developer lied to you, this is a B game sold at AAA price, not a real AAA, go ask for your refund right now\".\n",
      "What I can do is warn you about the bad decision you're about to make if you buy this repetitive, bad looking, poorly written and uninteresting game.Putting everything togheter, this game lacks good visuals, has a poor history, poor voice acting (not all, but most of them), a uninteresting main character with an uninteresting \"cuff\", the gameplay is repetitive, and sooner than you think you'll be asking yourself if you really should keep playing it as you won't feel compelled to discover more about anything in the game.Don't buy this game.\n",
      "Even when playing the game on hard difficulty, it didn't seem to have a big problem.Good gameplay but is not worth the full pricePositives:+ Vast world+ Fun action and gameplay+ So many combos to tinker with+ Graphic and effects are incredibleNegatives- Main story too short (very)- Unoptimized- Mediocre writings- OverpricedRating ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/10\n",
      "Unplayable, the frame rate drops immensely even when nothing is happening!I've played Cyberpunk on max graphics 120FPS, God of War, AC Oddsey, but I lag looking at the floor in a small apartment with the lowest settings??\n",
      "Actually when i played it, it feels more like childish game and not got satisfied with overall gameplay :(animation effects are good but and story is ok, not worth $50\n",
      "But the is some good news you can play it at a steady 60fps if you never once move the camera 🤣.In all seriousness the game is not absolutely terrible the movement is quite good and combat is okay and the loading is very fast.\n",
      "Now to the bad, I wish the characters would shut the hell up and this is coming from someone who played high on life and for such high system requirements you would expect a good looking game but nope it looks like a ps3 game.\n",
      "ATM save your money, the game is lacking a lot, first the acting is terrible, the facial expressions on the protagonist is very uncanny valley almost seems blank or should i say barely there for the situations that happen  to her in game, there is graphical rendering problems almost like they did with ff7 remake, the open world is empty and boring, too many cut scenes in the begining, gets to a point where u get irritated and just want to play but ur constantly being stopped due to conversation with the cuff or some other crap, the story is meh, everything is basically dull, Homer the cat is the only thing i like about the game so far.\n",
      "You instead abandon the bag, that's right there, to look for your cat, which is in another room, with the intention of going back for the bag, at which point, it's obviously too late.It doesn't exactly set the story and reactivity up for great expectations, now does it?Direct Storage is pretty awesome though.\n",
      "The story was not capturing from the start, the constant swearing, locked cameras, locked player movement, the cringing dialogue, the unappealing world...I'll play this again in a year or so when it's down to $20...maybe\n",
      "All I wanted was to enjoy some fast pace game play but no matter what I do, if I interact with a cat to start a side mission in which you have to follow it, I am frozen in place for 15 seconds at the start because of some stupid cut scene and then I am frozen for 15 more seconds once the cat finally leads me to some treasure as it forces you to stand still so you can receive XP from the mission.\n",
      "You might still think you want this game, I thought the same as I watched and read countless reviews in which they all explained how bad this game was and I thought to myself, \"They're wrong this game looks so fun and cool.\" It is not, if you want to spend money on a game you might as well pre-order Street Fighter 6 instead of getting this sorry excuse for a game.\n",
      "Wasted potential,Main character is an irredeemable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,Zones are empty and enemy variety is limited,Combat is run is circle and spam left click even on \"Hard\",Hard difficulty only increases maximum enemy hp making them damage sponges,Enemy AI is dumb as ♥♥♥♥, 2-3 attack variations max,Should of gotten shot in that alley and left there.A solid 2/10 for the magic parkour.\n",
      "Lesson learned..Oh and in case you were wondering the game doesn't get any better, the dialog is terrible (but you can turn the small talk off in the settings so that's good), the parkour isn't too bad, the story is pretty lackluster, the magic is the only thing in this game that I liked.\n",
      "more cut scenes then game play it feels like.\n",

      "Runs like ♥♥♥♥, story and people are god-awful annoying, terrible game all around.\n",
      "Play like ubisoft game, boring open world, game is very easy, boss fight looks good.\n",
      "where do i start...1st, game is riddled with cut-scenes way to many cant enjoy the game play2nd, i have to play on the lowest graphics to get over 60- fps mind you i max out at 75 fps3rd, story line is terrible/voice lines are boring and unappealing4th, game is not worth what is being charged a $15 game at best5th, the fact my game has to look like its for ps2 to get over 60 fps even though i have an i9 and a 4080 is insaly af6th, i played ps2 games that look better than this game and have been better written...overall DO NOT BUY THIS GAME its terrible...\n",
      "Problem is, which really pisses me off, the company had the adaucity to price this game 80$, like I know games got more expensie over the years but, c'mon, not even Elden Ring which is purely incredilbe costs this much, so that's why I'm gonna be much harsher on this review cas for 80$ you can buy so many other amazing games or do anything else better with you money then spend it on this cash grab, cas in my opinion this is what this is, straight up robbery for it's price and the quality of the game.\n",
      "First of the reasons I'm saying this it's because if you want to play on PC you need at least another $1600 to get an RTX 4090 to be able to play this at 60fps, and even then that's not guaranteed, and don't worry if you have an older graphics card you \"might\" be able to play this game in 720p30fps, just might, thought probably not.\n",
      "With her also saying ♥♥♥♥ every other sentence, it was just getting boringly annoying after a while.Now the story itself isn't half bad in my opinion if you only ignore what the main character is saying most of the time, though it is a little silly.\n",
      "Also, it's really stupid that you have to wait to talk with him just so you go into a cutscene right after, instead of just integrating the dialog into the cutscene.Now, one thing that is a bit of a saving grace for this game is the combat.\n",
      "In my opinion it would've been better if you could get some attacks faster as it gets pretty repetitive and boring, but I guess it is somewhat worth the wait when you finally get there.Also, one more thing that I kinda liked about the game is the parkour, it feels pretty nice, and you can do quite a bit of cool things, the only with complaint I have about it is that sometimes it feels like you only have to keep holding one button, and it does the rest for you.Now, something that I have to mention that is really dumb in this game are the difficulties.\n",
      "The attack patterns, attack speed and everything else remains the same, so I don't see a reason why anyone would choose to play it on hard difficulty when the game is easy no matter what, the only thing that is changing is the time you're wasting fighting the stupid AI in this game.The world on the other hand it is quite beautiful, but sadly, it also feels pretty dead and empty.\n",
      "While you're able to find a lot of treasures and items while exploring, none of them are really that useful in the completion of the game, and while you're able to find a few beasts and zombies to fight against when you're out there, it just feels like they have been just randomly scattered around the map.\n",
      "I get that the setting of this game is inspired by \"the plague\" which pretty much means it's all death and sorrow, but it's just not fun to run around the world and finding nothing major or rewarding.The graphics also nothing special either, with some pretty bad textures even on max quality, it doesn't really feel like you play a triple A game of 2023.\n",
      "I’m sitting on a 10700k, 4090, 64g ram and i’m pulling 30-40 fps in the first city… hard to play an action  game like that.\n",
      "I can barely play the game, so I would suggest waiting until its either cheaper or they optimize the PC port better\n",
      "sometimes its feels like im playing temple run coz of camera POV , poor optimize and voice acting is horrible.\n",
      "\"Console Optimized\" It feels like a game that would have done well 10 years ago but for 70$ it is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH FULL PRICE.\n",
      "Fospoken is a typical trope of an open world RPG game with Main story, side quest and completion events i'll call them just cause I can.\n",
      "Besides the bugs the combat is boring, easy even on hard, and 90% skipple you literally you can just run and collect mana as you go, like your collecting rings in a Sonic the Hedgehog game.\n",
      "Since the game feels like a suto Iziki anime story which i liked but the fact it won't launch anymore is sad and I can't recommend it to others to play.\n",
      "I really wanted to enjoy this game, and I did like exploring & spells, but the world is fairly empty, getting to the spells requires a lot of progression to get to that point, and some aspects of their \"parkour\" system work very poorly together.TL;DR: don't buy at full price, movement/spells are cool albeit don't always work great, requires lots of progression to get to the \"fun\" stuff, and a terrible ending.\n",
      "The levels are huge but completely devoid of any details, the character animations in cutscenes are more stiff than in your average Bethesda game.-  [Not quite correct, see update below] - The quality of the voice acting is very hit or miss.- There are random pauses ALL THE TIME.\n",
      "And also wait for a few seconds before and after.- Loading times are nice, though.Don't buy this game.___Small update about my complaints with the sound volumes: It looks like the mix is actually alright, but there was some weird issue with the game's 5.1 sound and my mainboard's onboard sound chip.\n",
      "Generic story, generic gameplay, bad BAD parkour.Unskippable cutscenes every 5 minutes, first half hour of the game is just badly written dialogue.\n",
      "Never have I felt so robbed before, and I didn't even buy the game.The combat is incredibly easy, I've started the game on the hardest difficulty that you can choose and so far not one enemy that I've encountered other than invincible high level ones actually given me a challenge, all the bosses I've fought can easily be killed by dodging every attack and back flipping in the air and then just clicking their health away.I have cookie clicker if i want to sit there and click my screen over and over, but this game does that too if that's what you want.The optimisation is beyond horrible, the fact that this game is such a huge size in cost and storage price is beyond me, this shouldn't be more than $50 or be 100gb for how bad it looks.The voice-acting is straight up bad, like jarringly bad in almost most scenes, and that's not even to mention the fact that all the cut-scenes and dialogues in this game take so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to skip and freeze your camera and are just annoying as hell.Its open-world but it is entirely empty, there are shrines you have to unlock for certain small buffs but that is about it, other than those it is almost empty except for enemies.Parkour is fun but it can be annoying sometimes, but mostly fun.If you want to buy this game i would suggest waiting for an update before playing, and for the love of god make sure you can actually run it beforehand.\n",
      "Graphics suck, open world sucks and is empty, ai is so cringe that it looks like a toddler did the animations in the cutscenes.\n",
      "Long story short, if you like open world combat driven games, then this could be for you after a decent sale.\n",
      "Its not a bad game, I liked it but not worth what they want for it now.\n",
      "Support magic takes a bit to long to recharge for my liking which makes some spells useless and not strong enough for the damage or skill.There's more but like this game I've had enough i only bought it because there was no games i wanted that month and for the price its worth maybe £20-30 in my opinion need a massive overhaul for me to come and play it again but i had a feeling when i saw it wasn't going to be great anyways so no surprise.\n",
      "Game it self could have been great but with how expansive the areas are and the points between quests it feels like they could have done better going smaller.\n",
      "Have not played in a month due to the lack of feel just not interested in even finishing it at this time as it does not draw you in maybe will try after a major update later but this was not worth the price tag it came with.\n",
      "3 hours in, might change review later as i play more but for now im having a hard time recommending this game and il list the reasons why.TL;DR they really dropped the ball on everything but graphics.\n",
      "unless you remap the entire games magic system manually to different keys like i did your expected use a radial menu that doesn't slow or pause game play to switch between skills.\n",
      "it wasn't until about 20 cut scenes of me standing around doing nothing later that i decided to try to find the tutorials after i missed another pop up trying to skip the god awful banter on my quest to play the game a little before i hit the five hour mark.\n",
      "4. immersion: 4/10i hope this gets better later, nothing breaks immersion like playing walking from cut scene of you doing nothing to cut scene of you ending up somewhere you could have gotten too by actually playing the game.\n",
      "normally id wait till; getting further in the game to make this call but since 2.8 hours of the first 3 hours of game play have been nothing but forced stale social interactions that you dont actually get to interact with i feel confident making this call now but will update later if we actually do get choices.\n",
      "6: Graphics 8/10The world so far is at least nice to look at, i have a i9 9900k, rtx 3090ti, and 64gb ddr4 ram so i cant really speak on the performance of the game for people not running it on a spaceship.\n",
      "Cut-scenes also seem to use a lot of fade out and fade in transitions for simple camera angle changes, which I believe is so the game has time to throw away the assets from one angle and load them from another.\n",
      "Was very hyped to play this game, however after loading in, it was mostly a dissapointment.Playing this with a high end setup (see below), and getting 60 fps, dropping to 50 during combat feels highly unoptimized.Not to forget that the graphic quality is nothing like the videos showcase on the ultra settings.\n",
      "During narrative between you and the bracelet, your ui is frozen and you cant walk or look around, which feels a bit restricted, these chats are not skippable for some reason....The gameplay however feels nice, despite it being advertised as a high end graphical game, the combat system feels fluent, and the story line is alright.\n",
      "It seems like the developers intentionally frontloaded the game to play better to try to scurry around the now standard 2-hour refund policy.\n",
      "There's little to no actual gameplay - I honestly don't know if I'd like it or not because I never got a chance to actually experience it outside the tutorial.The story is fine, but the dialogue is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n",
      "Story,  is like cheap companies games, so not worth to pay that much and play.\n",
      "I hope this game was rushed and not just poorly designed.EDIT: Seems to have been some of both.Gameplay once you get past all the issues: GreatThere are mechanics that work very well, and you get more the further you progress.All the dialog at the beginning: TRASHThe voice acting is good, but the lip synching is not.And so may things just do not make sense as choices in the starting story.Why does the game pause when I am trying to navigate around the map?I cannot get over the fact that this is nowhere near polished, optimized or free from issues when running.\n",
      "And you charge $70 for something that you have to play for literal hours before it starts to get good.Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, with fur looks like a wire mop.EDIT: There are times when a mob will load in and look horrid, but then correct itself.\n",
      "The traversal/parkour is fantastic, combat is easy yet fun, music and audio are decent, graphics are okay but the environments can be beautiful, characters are largely uninteresting, and the story is rushed.\n",
      "Played the whole game, and I would recommend it maybe if it was like a $20-$30 game but the price tag on it right now is ridiculous.\n",
      "Only gets little exciting at the very end.- Specs and bugs: I didn't come across any major issues, but I've read that people were facing a lot of memory related issues with this game, as it doesn't seem to be properly optimised.Overall 6/10 for me.\n",
      "Based on the build quality and feel of the game you would say it is an under 30$ indie title yet it is priced like a major blockbuster....not worth the money even if you can get it at half price..\n",
      "its not the worst game I have ever played, the combat can actually be  quite fun at times, but the graphics are absolutely shocking for a 2023 game, some games from 2015 look better than this, and despite how bad it looks, its optimised terribly, a 3070 should smash this game going by how it looks, and yet barely manages 60fps stable at 1440!?\n",
      "I can assure you having played the ps5 demo, this is actually a marked improvement over the ps5 version which is like playing a game with bubbles in front of you, trees no further than 30 yards away look blurry, how they F'ed up the graphics and optimisation in this game so badly is beyond me, when FF15 looked very good at its release.\n",
      "First off it looks nice but not 80 euro nice, it's main character is anoying, From what I played it looks like there is only one city with humans in it, outside of that it's just monsters and a lot of dialog between you and your accsassory anoyingly so, and did I say the MC is kinda stupid.I also had a lot of stuttering during gameplay I do not reccommend this game at all\n",
      "Needless to say nothing made me truly care about Frey’s internal struggles she just came of as unlikable and rude.I kept waiting for there to be some kind of redemption arc here for this character but even at the end of the game and after  completing all side quests it never felt to me like she changed.CuffThis character comes off as some sort of comic relief and it works sometimes but you need to adjust the frequency of the chatter in the game menu.\n",
      "Most of the mana you will pick up will come from simple collection of it in the open world.The Combatthe combat and parkour together make this pretty fun but with the lack of enemy diversity it is easy to memorize all of the different attack patterns etc.\n",
      "But wait for performance patches cause 30-45fps (10-30 in areas and crowded fights) is not worth struggling with to play the game.\n",
      "don't waste your money or time on this one , its a bad movie with an average gameplay or it an average game with too many cut scenes.\n",
      "Maybe the game gets better after playing it longer (I only got 30 minutes in, after the first combat) but I wasn't gonna wait to find out.\n",
      "At first hand i was getting good fps, but then when it took me to the real game i was getting atleast 50-70 fps, and i thought maybe it was just for that area just because there was alot of people, but when i started running around and killing enemies thats when i noticed that game was poorly optimized...So maybe lower my setting?\n",
      "The world and story are solid, but the performance issues are just so overwhelmingly noticeable-- and the slow movement speed inside of cities gets rather grating.If this game goes through a few rounds of optimization and QoL touch ups then it could be something real solid.\n",
      "As-is, I'm starting to regret buying this for the high price of $70-- it doesn't live up to the next gen hype at all.Maybe it's my fault for \"only\" running a 3070 and a 5800x3d with 64GB of RAM-- I'm sure having a 4080+ would help out a bit with the performance issues, but when a 3070 can still have issues on the lowest graphics settings on 1440p, it seems like an issue.If you're someone who has a top of the line system and can deal with the story-heavy nature of the game where cutscenes and dialogue will eat up a good deal of time, the combat system and boss fights are actually pretty solid.\n",
      "Dodge this game for now, its not worth it even if you dont experience bugs/glitches/♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics because the concept has been executed in such a slow and stale manner that it feels like the devs have never played a game like this and are intentionally stalling you.\n",
      "I really had high hopes for this game, but it feels like an incomplete game from 2010 with some enjoyable aspects.Enjoyable aspects: - fun combat system and parkour - beautiful magic effects - nice nature - so many activities to doincomplete game from 2010: - one of the most annoying or maybe the most annoying thing for me is how heavily scripted the game.\n",
      "So if you sum up the freezing times with, you'll get like 5-10 minutes + the boring/annoying cutscenes with noname characters.\n",
      "Another annoying thing.- Minor bugs: like texture flashing during cutscenes...- The story: Yes, the game is cringy.\n",
      "The main character is also whining the whole time.The mechanics they introduce are simplistic and boring (attack + dodge, yup that's it aside from having to mix up attacks that match the enemy presented and forced mechanics to unlock certain skills like hitting from behind when snared).\n",
      "The game is very pretty so if you like to just experience the story you should do exactly that and set the difficulty down along with whatever other helpers you feel like (apparently you can make almost every action automatic, e.g. dodging attacks).\n",
      "The game play is just too bland and the story is just not fun to experience when the fights just take longer and aren't any harder at higher difficulty along with being constantly insulted by \"Cuff\".\n",
      "Pretty game ruined by bad writing and poor controls.Story spoiler as it relates to the above \"Cuff\" nonsense:\n",
      "The execution in this game however is pretty bad to a point it started to annoy me within the first 30 minutes.The Combat feels somewhat sluggish.Graphics:really, look at my screenshots.\n",
      "But like i said in the beginning: the game takes away your control for every bit of exposition, which i found quite annoying.Verdict:Dont buy, really bad game, especially for the price tag.\n",
      "Gameplay is great when it happens, but sadly in my 3 hours of play time i've had at most 20 mins of non tutorial gameplayIf the writing wasn't as bad I would love to play more, I like the vambrace character but god is every other character either boring or annoyingJRPG developers + western writers doesnt ever seem to work out\n",
      "The combat and parkour mechanics are fun, making the demo worth trying(it is what made it possible for me to finish the game).\n",
      "This is one of the worst optimized game that I have played in a long long time.\n",
      "I overall have to agree with the reviews that say that the game world feels kind of lifeless and empty.There are a lot of nice mechanics at the game's core like the parcour and the combat system, but the game feels kind of unpolished in many areas.The game probably has a lot of potential, but there is still a lot of work to be done.Personally, the main protagonist also was kind of annoying in her overall demeanor, which did not help the overall impression.The dialogues with the bracelet are also getting stale very fast and start to repeat themselves.Maybe the game can get a recommendation after some polishing, but at its current state it is not very enjoyable and way too overpriced.\n",
      "I was expecting way more by how it was marketed, even playing it on high-end pc a lot of stuttering and fps drop when casting spells, the world doesn't seem too vast and complicated so probably due to poor optimization of hardware, my gameplay :\n",
      "You dont really have to time dodges as you can just hold the parkour button, and Frey will auto dodge, similar to Noctis from FFXV, speaking of which, it really feels like they took a lot from FFXV in terms of uninteresting enemies to fight in the open world, they just don't do much towards you.\n",
      "The textures look like they stem from an early 2000s game and i cannot get it to run at a stable 30fps.\n",
      "But, the story isn't good and The ending was like one long cut scene that I just didn't want to pay attention too.\n",
      "First of all this is an initial impression of the game, i didn't dive into deeper mechanics so this review could easily be replaced by actual experience with the demo I presume, but for a reason the demo was available on the release day, I can tell You that, as well as reviews.When I sat down to play the game I was approaching it with open mind but also in mind of it's hefty price tag.The distributor decided the high price point so that is how it will be reviewed so as a premium +++ game.The first thing we get is an introduction to the story, poor girl, dragged through life, living as a street small time thief, worst type of movie plot which is hollow.\n",
      "The story after that gets better, new world, new quests, more interesting caracters, but the Hollywood storytelling is present and takes away a bit of the experience.Getting to performance, if You got a High end PC(don't have it, not tested) or PS5, You may be getting an eye candy, but heard of FPS dips, when it comes to low end PC's I got my steam deck and it's playable and I managed it to look decent, but forget about stable 30 FPS.\n",
      "There are some things that are revolutionizing like parkour and fluidity of combining it with combat, but also the feeling of indie game when it comes to performance, story and many other small mechanics.\n",
      "If I got a parkour Elden Ring alike experience I would happily throw 70$ at them smoking a cigarette afterwards like after a good You know what :), but in this case I scratch my head asking myself \"Am I dumb to spend that much money on a mediocre game?\".\n",
      "While I enjoy the  theme, and I was hopeful that combat mechanics and world design would make the story/dialogue tolerable, this game is just not for me.\n",
      "Combat has a lot of options, traversal is fun, and there are some genuinely good ideas in the story.For a $70 next-gen tentpole, however, this game is incredibly disappointing.\n",
      "That's excusable if you're a tiny studio lacking resources; that's inexcusable if you're working under Square Enix and the last game in this engine, FFXV, looks better and runs better despite being five years older.If you're curious how this trainwreck happened, it might be worth getting on a (very) deep discount.\n",
      "Little to no game play it feels like.\n",
      "So far the game looks good and it has big map RBG but the voice acting is vary bad don’t recommend to buy at full price buy it when there 50% or more off price .\n",
      "Very choppy performance for graphics that is like mixing a 10 years game with some modern update...\n",
      "After some tinkering (including lowering the resolution....) i was able to make the game run at a decent framerate, leaving me with a blurry outdated looking game for the sake of a decent framerate, despite my pc rig beeing not bad at all (rx6700 with 5800x3d).But the main problem for me is the ABSOLUTE TRASH that are some textures, i always have in my view some ps1 game texture even after trying every vram utilisation, the game even reports that i have only 8gb of vram when in fact i have and is using 10gb, this with a direct storage compatible system (direct storage works wonders during loading times truly amazing).The sad part is under heavy technical limitations there is possibly some truly inspiring gameplay, unluckily i have to shelve the game, until and if optimization problem will be solved.\n",
      "Well, most of the time it looks like a game from 2015.\n",
      "this game is bad like really bad dont waste your time or money\n",
      "I have no idea how a game can look so terrible and still perform so incredibly poorly, i got this for free with my gpu and i still feel scammed\n",
      "$70 price tag on a $40 game.Combat is fun, story is terrible, writing is pretty bad, characters are boring, progression is linear, map isn't great, and some of the textures don't match resolutions.\n",
      "Not to mention the constant forcing you to stand still to listen to dialogue from the brace which is attached to the character, so there was no reason to stop just to converse.The action has been interesting but the way that the story is presented has some really strange issues that really shouldn't exist in a game that asks for this much money in 2023.\n",
      "The Cuff is the most annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character in the game and just sounds incredibly bored and dull half the time.\n",
      "Seriously, just running and parkouring around the world is so much fun.I would recommend at least playing the demo to see if you like the gameplay and if it runs well on your PC.I'm running an RTX 4070ti and am currently CPU bound by an i7 8700.\n",
      "It runs just fine at high settings with quality DLSS.Edit:I am disappointed by how short the main game is, $70 is already asking a lot and it feels like they cut content near the end, it is insulting they're asking $25 more for DLC.\n",
      "Over time, I've got to say that I am less and less interested in this game the more I play it.\n",
      "(performance is crap)Story is meh.Voice acting is horrible.Graphics last gen.Crashes.Had bugs and glitches after 15min gameplay.Gunplay or magicplay is okay at best.79,99€ ?Unlikable protaganist imho.PROS: Boss fights are entertaining at best.\n",
      "Hope the optimisation will get better, but until that happens I don't feel like playing this game.\n",
      "the combat is cool and all but the whole game is really bad , if you really want to try it i recommend to buy it at sale.Combat:8/10Story:5/10i had alot of frame drops with rtx 4090 and 10900k with dlss on .overall:6/10\n",
      "this game could be fun but it runs very bad how is a 3070 and intel i5 13600k give me low frames just choppy but playing the game could be fun but wait for patches if they ever do it\n",
      "*Spoilers*Wait for a discount, The combat is a lil repetitive, dialogue is poorly written, the main character, while a fish out of water, is not very likable, traversal is interesting, 2nd half of the game is just a MAD rush to the end.\n",
      "The story is lame , interaction with npc's looks like a low budget with dialogue of a Netflix cheap woke series, with short loading screens .\n",
      "I have incredible running PC with a 3090 and 128GB of ram yet no matter what I do to this game, unless I make it look like a clay-animation that was molded by a five year old I am unable to play the game which is sad really.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the combat and buildcrafting.However, even with a decently competent system (RTX 3090 and Ryzen 9 5950X, playing in 3440x1440), the game struggles to even hit 60fps.\n",
      "damn games from 2010 looks better than thiscombat: good luck, its really like a bad port from psthe things game got new: THE RUN, well good luck on running on buildings or stuck in some dumb rocksthe game feels so empty like there are no mobs at all to fight withfps: aaaaa good luck with that too if u don't have a good gpu with more than 8gbdialogue: f..k every cinematics yeh thats nice, don't let kids play itmy opinion worst game so far in 2023, get it if you wanna try when its 40 euro or something\n",
      "poorly optimized game for the pc, absolutely horrible graphics that cannot run 60 FPS without the GPU going 100% full power\n",
      "other than that, the gameplay of this game was fantastic, with the spells, and the world being so vast and exploritive, it created a sweet world with unfortunatley a lot of problems and also lifeless side characters and a  bit of a wonky story.\n",
      "The game has great potential but its poorly optimized, the cutscenes and gameplay have stutters, the bracelet is annoying mostly cause they freeze you in place for meaningfull (not) speeches.\n",
      "Runs like hot ass.3080, i7 10700k, normal settings, rt off, dlss on or off, getting 45 fps in the first Athia open world section.That's pretty unacceptable so will come back after patches and a sale.\n",
      "(I am running it on a I7-10700k, RTX 3060TI 32GB RAM)Cut scenes are way too long and drag out the story too much, which takes away from the game play, it could be condensed so much while still getting the same point across.\n",
      "however, one should not have long loading screens when they have a decent PC.The story is kind of boring - and Frey, does not portray it very well.Game play mechanics, are okay, easier to manage magic than i initially thought, although fighting gets stale  quick, its the same mechanics for every enemy!\n",
      "I have fun with this though!I am only 9 hours or so into the game, and i would imagine that a lot of that time, was spent on the loading screens.\n",
      "It would have been okay if the character actually learns something to improve as a person instead of being shoehorned in the whole \"this is your fault and you must fix it\" trope for some faux moral lesson on taking responsibility and accepting the call to action, which Frey rejects throughout 2/3 of the story.The combat is passable, some of the spells are cool but a good third of them are practically useless.\n",
      "I saw a tech video by the devs saying how they overhauled the GI for their in-house engine for this game and it feels so ironic that a robust graphics engine called Luminous has some of the worst Illumination of this generation.At best this is like a 4/10 game and I cannot recommend people pay full price for a not even half baked game that got delayed by a whole year and still feel buggy and unfinished.\n",
      "I would have considered recommending it but the story, the annoying ass character writing and the floaty, disconnected feel I get from the world just ruined it for me.*edit*Game actually got worse the more I played.\n",
      "This is one of is not the most boring game i've ever played, im only about an hour in and im already bored out of my mind, the game feels like a chore, and dont even get my started on the performance, also the constant bits of corny dialogue that adds nothing to the plot is extremely annoying just let me play the damn game, all in all i give it a 2/10.\n",
      "(Even PSO2 is better than this.)- This game doesn't have a simple dodge.- The attack and block buttons are the same.Plus (This is annoying, but if the combat system works, I can endure it.)- There are too many plot holes in the story.- Too many cutscenes.- Too much dialogue that she should be able to walk while listening to them talk, but she stops and just talks.Say something good?- For me graphic and optimization are fine.- Lovely cat.- I like how they created a new franchise for black women rather than replacing someone with her.\n",
      "Korra, like this main character in this game, is really self absorbed and annoying wile the word around is really good.\n",
      "Combat is good but not very challenging, liked the open word, liked the movement, boss battles where boring, liked the different enemy types, side quests Bad, main story meh, map loading times really BAD.\n",
      "Story - Abominable (no really, just play long enough and you'll get it)Cutscenes/Dialog - Jfc, just dont, mute the game and skip the cutscenes (Moronic Protag, stupid nonsensical world,                                 Locations dont make sense corresponding to events that happen and should change the \"feel/vibe\",                                 imagine High on Life dialog but ultra bad)Combat - kinda mid, not even remotely as terrible as everything else, but for what it could have been (and the foundation                 was rather solid too) the potential that was realized really was subpar and not convincing enough to say this is                 \"the best combat\" or anything along those linesEnding - Yea for sure they didnt forget to flesh out / polish that section of the game lmao, second ending was rather                offensive to even include because it just makes this glaring weakness just hit that much harderThoughts: It just had to be offensively bad compared to what could have been a really intersting take on a Isekai story (at least entertaining would have been enough), put the value composition into the formula too and you have a straight up ♥♥♥♥ game for 70€, Yes its apperently been in development hell but to push out this abomination and pretend (and even argue to fans/customers) that their opinions/criticisms aren't valid because of not being \"woke\" enough (or worse being sexist/racist) just about does it for me.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!Its not what its advertised to be.Very Slow...Too many cut scenes -Combat Mechanics are way too easy -Bad acting -Takes up too much memory -Your Controls are disabled for more than 1/2 the game watching cut scenes and loading -I would only buy this game if I got it for free and had nothing else to do - nice scenery and plays out more like an interactive netflix movie.***Review Continued After 60 more hours of play time***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!What a waste of Money!\n",
      "There is NO IMMERSION and Progression is elementary and it is NOT Open World format.Seriously the Cut Scenes are absolutely USELESS and take up MORE THAN 60% of your game time.\n",
      "game runs really bad even on good hardware.....DON\"T BUY!!\n",
      "Took about 2 hours while skipping most of the skippable cut scenes to make it to the open world.I received the game for free and am still questioning the cost of a 100GB games and hours of bad cut scenes, black screens, and not being able to move while talking watching the character standing still and talking to herself.The \"parkour\" is mostly randomly running at and move over buildings.\n",
      "No, I have yet to figure out the limitations on where the game is fun to play, or where you cannot use parkour because it doesn't fit the upcoming cut scene.\n",
      "After 5h I have to say I like the Setting and the Movement/fighting of the Game BUT it's 100% not worth the price!No Day/night Cycle.The Skybox is there...\n",
      "Unfortunately I can't really recommend this at the moment since each time I've tried to play I've had a \"File Corrupted\" type message and I've now had to reinstall the game...UPDATE: I've now reinstalled and it's no longer crashing.\n",
      "I usually don't write reviews and I got this game for free with my RX 6650XT on which the game was played @1080p, but I feel like I should protect all of you who would pay for this nonsense of a game.I really do not know where to start...\n",
      "I was super excited having watched the trailers and gameplay, the game looked like something different, something fresh.\n",
      "also how the hell am i gonna get a Rtx 4080 just for this seriously ignore this game until its lower priced and they fix this F***ing dumb system requirements WASTE OF MONEY Buy Hogwarts Legacy if you want a better time.\n",
      "Unlike most folks I actually like Frey a lot and the overall world and combat felt great to play...\n",
      "The game performed well on my machine, but it wasn't worth the time I spent getting the settings to work.\n",
      "The story was pretty crap, the character makes decisions that just don't make sense sometimes.The first major thing that stood out to me was when The story just felt so forced to go the way they tell it rather than \"Does this make sense?\" Cause frankly there are some things that just don't, even in a fantasy setting where someone like me, a New Yorker, should be able to find common ground with another New Yorker being thrust into an unknown world.Now the swearing, I saw a bunch of people talking about her fowl mouth.\n",
      "I feel like that was very out of place for someone already thrust into a world they didn't want to be in and helps to really show they didn't think this out too well.While yes this is a fantasy story, the character is meant to be from a realistic setting and should at least in the beginning have realistic reactions to the unfamiliar.\n",
      "Maybe that's explained later in the story, but right from the start she comes off as poorly written and this only adds to that.At full price, do not buy this game.\n",
      "I would say it will probably be fine at a half off price tag in the future if you wanna deal with the cringe ass dialogue.The gameplay itself seemed fun and kinda unique, but if it's anything like the writing it's not gonna evolve well as the game goes on.One thing I will give this game.\n",
      "honestly the story and main character are terrible something straight out of a Disney movie but the rest is decent like movement kinda combat\n",
      "I even chose at the beginning of the game the option for open world and i still feel like I am being hand held on everything.\n",
      "Crashed 5 times in the second cinematic, 10/10Edit: got to play a bit, nice 20fps having the \"recommended specs\".Gameplay is fun but...\n",
      "The controls are terrible, the story is terrible, the voice acting was just awful, the game does not even look good.\n",
      "Many times i felt very restrricted as a player as for whatever reason for an open world game it restricts control of your character.\n",
      "Unless you like sitting through hours of diologue  before getting to actual game I wouldn't give this a buy.\n",
      "Combat is also great, lots of combos potentials but camera feels a little \"clunky\".But, that's it.There's too much cut scenes in this game, the first chapters can be a shore and to be really honest: The story so far isn't great.\n",
      "But my mistake was not playing through way more of the demo to figure out the game's premise seems to be: open world action.\n",
      "It's open world but the entire game is revolving around the main story & fighting along the way.\n",
      "The game feels like it's honestly very short (and unpolished) if you're not the type of person to really explore everything (complete everything on the map, fight every mutant, etc).\n",
      "Movement feels fluid & you can't really abuse i-frames like in some games which makes combat more enjoyable.\n",
      "I received this product for free with the purchase of a GPU last summer.This is not worth $70.The camera lock runs counter to what you'd hope for in an open-world game and just feels weird.\n",
      "If you're looking for a parkour ARPG, but you've already played all the AC games, just wait a few months on this one; it'll either get patched to toleration or be heavily discounted.\n",
      "stopped by loads of cut scenes, had issues with the game crashing, a lot graphics were pretty unoptomized, the only good part was the combat which was fluid and pretty fun but looks to get repetitive pretty quick, edit going to try more to see if it gets better looked at some fixs for crashing\n",
      "After playing for a while, I can say that this game has received a lot of undue hate regarding the story and gameplay.\n",
      "The game will be choppy and look like a slideshow when combat starts, then midway through jump back up to 100 frames, then dip again when just traversing with no enemies around.\n",
      "This game doesn't look good enough to be struggling with my hardware like it is.\n",
      "If I had spent $30 on this game, I would have been okay with the game, but unfortunately, the price of a game very much sets my expectations for it, and Forspoken does not even reach half way to the expectations I have for a $70 USD game.Honestly, didn't hate the story or the characters, the game itself just plays horribly.\n",
      "I've tried my absolute hardest to like this game through its atrocious story and framerate issues but even the gameplay can't save this one.\n",
      "There are other Open World Games which look better AND run with more FPS.\n",
      "My biggest complaint is the game is just not worth this new next-gen price tag, regardless of how many hours I'll have to force myself to play to get my money's worth.\n",
      "And the main character is a b*tch for no reason, to the point where its hard to play the game as her.\n",
      "This Review took me some time as there were much better games released recently that I would rather play.So i finally finished the game and i can still say that I would really like to recommend this game for the traversal parkour and some of the combat gameplay but I cannot in good conscience recommend the game due to the huge problems that this game has with story telling, characters and general gameplay activities and loop.For now let me start with the positives that stay pretty good throughout the game, the parkour across the maps terrain is fun and it the game allows you to traverse pretty quickly quite early on which is fun to do and puts the thought of infamous but with magic instead of superpowers.\n",
      "This brings me onto point 2 the story is bad, very bad and involves the dumbest main character I've seen in a long time I mean this character in the first 10 minutes of the game (before they get powers) starts mocking and making jokes at another character who is holding a gun TO THE MAIN CHARACTERS THROAT they only get away due to a combination of luck and the fact that the character with the gun forgets she has one as the main character hops a chain link fence and mocks them again, prompting me to shout at the screen \"you have a gun, you can just shoot me right now\" at the screen.\n",
      "In fact throughout the entire story the main character is completely insufferable with no redeeming qualities, she is rude, selfish, thoughtless, an animal abuser (she claims to have no money for her cats food at the beginning despite owning some expensive looking shoes which she could probably sell to feed her cat) and a thief now while some of that could work in a character that we as a player aren't meant to like it feels like the developers despite this desperately want you to like this character but throughout my entire play time i could not have cared less about her.\n",
      "The game Takes ages to take off the reins and give you control to explore and once you do finally get set free on the map the story only manages to achieve some minor intrigue when it comes to the layout and design of the magic world itself.\n",
      "The post credit reveal is also an insane decision not made in aid of the story but instead made so that the main character doesn't just chat to themselves like a psychopath or so they didn't have to make her silent (which would improve the game).The map itself is mostly barren and only contains the sort of content that you would expect to find in a Ubisoft game and if the traversal weren't so fun i would have stopped playing about 2 hours in.\n",
      "The size of the game is also insane for a new game especially when you consider that it doesn't look groundbreaking or anything i was playing on max settings and the characters looked off in almost every scene although i have heard that the PC version looks worse than the PS5 version so maybe its just because of that.Finally, there are times when the game takes all control from you and makes you just stand in one place for dialogue this happens way too often and it is constant throughout the story and I don't see why as most other games allow you to move and listen to dialogue and this game does it too on occasion so this annoying choice to halt all movement to have you just stand there is just confusing, the first time it happened (in the first 5 minutes of the game i might add) I thought my game had broken.so i gave the game a 5/10 when was just a few hours in but after finishing the game I'm going to lower that to a 4/10 because the end of the game just dragged on and on, I just wanted it to be over because it completely lost me.\n",
      "Combat is good, but the game overall is not worth the price without like a year's worth of patches to polish the game.\n",
      "I noticed inconsistent performance dips (slowdowns) on high settings in open spaces, with nothing in particular going on.I didn't play around graphics settings much, because I wanted to focus more on gamplay given the limited time not to miss the refund window.\n",
      "3 crashes in 2 hours.Stop letting AAA companies get away with this - don't buy trash like this game.\n",
      "In between you do get lots of time to explore and fight, but when you have a cutscene, you're looking at having like 10 more cutscenes right after one another, with about 3 seconds of you moving your character in between.\n",
      "It's not a great game, the combat system is fun, grab this on a DEEP deep discount if you want to enjoy being like...\n",
      "This game is so underwhelming, graphics feel like it was made for the PS3.\n",
      "I have one issue with this game, one thing, one massive thing:The story telling.It's horrid.The voice acting is off key, the animations in cut-scenes doesn't match the VA and the writing is just dull.\n",
      "I have 2 issues with the game: the special cape and necklace I got from pre-ordering or whatever, it looks bad, like really really bad.\n",
      "I'm like 8 hours in and I would currently advise against buying until two things happen:- Optimization - Price drop/discount\n",
      "Combat is great and parkour elements are enjoyable but besides that, there is unfortunately nothing more.Story could be good but the terrible voice acting and facial movements just kills everything.Also, NPC's in this game are literally NPC's no life at all.The exchange between Frey and Cuff is just so awkward and nonstop insults...\n",
      "this gangsta attitude from Frey gets really annoying fast.I've played for 5 hours but it feels like I am forcing myself to play Forspoken just because I paid for this game a lot...\n",
      "TLDR: Fun for silly exploring in a really pretty world, gameplay has a lot variety but no depth, and story at the end gets good, rest is mid to bad.\n",
      "Movement is good, which is also your main method of evading in combat, some of the later upgrades for movement make it more fun to explore but that happens way too late if you already just want to finish story.\n",
      "yet with this game I have to put everything on LOW and still the FPS can't even maintain a 30 despite having better than the minimum requirements.There is basically no optimization done on this game and they expect only people with supercomputers to play it I guess.\n",
      "Image what a real fall out game would look like, with no people nothing to do but talk to what is essentially yourself the whole time.\n",
      "That level of meta was too much for me too handle, you have to understand that playing this game makes you *FEEL* like you burnt your money away.The frame rate, the graphics...\n",
      "Seems like a nice game, but needs optimisation.Will change my review as soon as it will run on 3060 with 60 fps\n",
      "I chose open world, and it seemed like multiple parts were meant to have quick time events and didn't.I saw other reviews commenting on the graphics before I purchased the game, and I thought 'Hey, it can't be that bad, right?' Its that bad.\n",
      "Many games from 2017 with much much better graphics performance and eye-candies have no problems running at 4k 60fps+ with max settings on an Nvidia 3070 Ti OC.Extremely overpriced for what it offers and pathetic optimization.\n",
      "After playing this game for like 6 hours I feel I've seen enough to give a review If it wasn't for poor optimisation settings I think this game would of got more love, however it's pretty bad with huge frame drops at certain areas of the game.This really lets it down despite the story being decent and good combat with some nice spells you can learn to use on enemies.There is clear slowdown at times and I noticed my FPS would drop from like 90-40 in no time & also if you move the player camera it drops 10 frames even when Frey is standing still lolSome areas it's on 30-40 fps which isn't good, it seems to be very inconsistent if you want to maintain a high end framerate without pathetic drops for no apparent reasonOther games I've played with better Graphics don't require as much GPU Memory so it's weirdSo clearly this game needs to be patched in terms of performanceI have messed around with lower settings but it feels largely the Graphic settings are just there for a Gimmick because it doesn't improve FPS yet my PC is high end!!If your're ignoring FPS i'd say it does perform mostly smoothly until it just drops in performance at moments, I'd say it doesn't really ruin my enjoyment of playing the game if that's a positive, if i'm not wondering about the FPS I can actually enjoy looting and killing moving onto the next mission.I'd also have to say this game shouldn't be so poorly released when ray tracing doesn't look good and a few other graphic settings don't seem to work eitherSo unless Square Enix can fix all the performance issues then I wouldn't recommend this game if you're high on performanceThe game looks decent enough visually but I wouldn't say it's amazing and it should be a lot better considering the requirements\n",
      "even if they fixed the optimization you won't enjoy it as much as you want.edit : after a short 22 hours (with breaks), game is finished.the cut scenes will exahust you, at the last hour i just wanted to finish and delete the game.combat system is fair, the game feels like a remake and unpolished, character is too cringe and unlikeable, repetitive, a very small variety of everything, monsters, your drops, not even a normal leveling system, all you do is upgrade your stuff to certain point and than nada untill the end game.\n",
      "If I had had the opportunity to understand what this game was, I would have returned it instead of continuing past the 2 hour guided cutscene it calls an intro.Don't waste your money on this, play something better.\n",
      "In any town, it feels like the game is trying to run on rails.\n",
      "It can only be explained by magic, but it still looks terrible and I want to gouge out my eyes every time I see it.-Every new \"biome\" has easy to find way-points on the map and I felt compelled to clear them all to 100% the game, but it was just SO BORING!\n",
      "Using the same magic attacks and staying out of range of the melee attack and behind cover from the ranged attacks, mostly using rooftops because they wouldn't go up there to fight you.Honestly I could go on for days about all the little things that I didn't like about the game, but as you can see that I've only played 14.1 hours in the game.\n",
      "Sadly, myself like many others are unable to run the game without stuttering left and right while in combat, and the delay between when I move my mouse and when the camera moves in game is a LOT...\n",
      "for a game that requires precision it's extremely annoying and like I said, I spent 2 hours trying to fix it by changing everything.\n",
      "I understand there are tutorial elements at first but actually let me explore on my own and come across the crafting and magic stuff on my own and not force it for the first 2+ hours of the game (I'm at 2.6 now and just left the beginning city).\n",
      "I like the story and some of the game play so far, but don't want to run through it until hopefully its fixed and then maybe I'll update my review.\n",
      "it looks like I have LOD at -10I also have some gripes with the game's content.- unnecessary cutscenes, jarring transitions- egregious amount of exposition/talking that adds nothing to the story- a really unlikeable protagonist- voice acting most of the times feels subpar- so far?\n",
      "not smooth and sluggish, imo a good comparison is DMC5; it feels amazing to play right off the bat, smooth and did weapon switching (in forspoken's case: spell switching) much better without removing the ability to control your camera and using the imo iffy joystick/mouse movement- i personally just hate the button mapping on both controller and pc; also see above~ crafting system is really basic~ the inventory is there?~+ you get a cool way to traverse the world pretty much instantly+ interesting enough combat with cool looking spells (problem is, it takes time to get to the cool stuff, i also went in expecting something like DMC and..\n",
      "The beginning pacing is really good and gets you interested in the story but then it opens the world and feels really directionless.\n",
      "After 45 minutes of gameplay, I have sat through multiple boring and uninspired cut scenes and maybe have gotten 5 minutes of actually playing the game.\n",
      "Good - The trailer looked awesome, The abilities LOOKED amazing, most of the open world looked awesome, the parkour was pretty awesome as well (similar to Prototype and Infamous).Bad - With where we are at in the world as far as game development technology, I did expect much more.\n",
      "Selecting the difficulty was a bit odd due to the names as \"Take Part in Challenging Battles\" was used instead of just simply \"Hard\", as the same thing can be said for easy and normal difficulty.The main character of the game (Frey) is a VERY unlikable character as she's also just unreasonably rude for no apparent reason.Hard difficulty didn't feel hard at all, as all that had changed was the amount of HP the enemies had as they continued to mindlessly run head first into my attacks.Overall I wouldn't recommend buying this game, unless you got it for free then I do hope you're able to enjoy the game.\n",
      "Graphically the game looks okay...but everything just looks FLAT which makes the bad performance questionable, I understand it is a newly released IP and AMD is partially to blame for my personal performance issues with no day one driver on RX 6000 series.The open world is not very detailed and feels completely empty for the most part, even if the world of Athia's population is reduced etc it still feels very empty (Not really a whole lot of anything to see).\n",
      "I've played through 10 hours of this game so far and I've done a lot of exploring, did not find much.\n",
      "The combat is really fun but gets repetitive quickly but I suppose that comes down to the player, it is very fun at times and probably the best thing about this game in my opinion.So far in this game there has been nothing that gives the impression that Forspoken is worth $70 at launch, it seems like nothing but a shameless cash grab with some awesome combat.\n",
      "man i was realy looking forwards to this game and now we got it and ir runs like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i wish i never bought this i hope they fix it soon bcs before u get the \"open world\" u have to sit through almost 2 hour of just boring ass cutcenes would i recomend buying this game no not in this state also not to mension the every 10 to 20 mins of crashing when u go in a fight but i do say story wise it looks fun i just cant play it much bcs of crashing but yea\n",
      "For a game that is advertised as huge open world exploration and lots of vast magic they really spent the first hour and a half of gameplay shoving your teeth into a rail road track and telling you to enjoy it.Bad story, i don't care about the protagonist.Bad introduction, JUST LET ME PLAY!\n",
      "all for TERRIBLE story development.Bad texture alignment, this game looks like its a PS3 game in 2023, I'm playing on a 7900 XTX with ultra settings and cringing at the shoddy textures where one ends and another begins with a straight stitch line.After beating the game I'd still stand by the thought that this game is definitely not worth the price.\n",
      "A bit heartbroken honestly: I really want to like this game, I was so excited for it, but this game is so poorly optimized and glitchy, it has crashed constantly and stutters a lot even on lower settings.\n",
      "After playing for just over one hour I cannot recommend this game although the combat is kinda fun the game is poorly optimised (even in performance mode) which ultimatly takes the fun out of the game.\n",
      "I wanted to do the things to pick up whatever story may be there and the rewards associated with them, but unsure if I will be getting back to it or not to try again.Square is also at this point giving the development team just enough time (read as rushing since it was originally supposed to arrive in the Summer) to satisfy the promised DLC for the pre-orders before closing them down on May 1st 2023 so likely not much to look forward to if you have issues with the optimization or other bugs.\n",
      "There are way too many cut scenes that are too long interrupting game play/flow.\n",
      "I figured, why not, let's see if it's is bad as folks say.I cannot recommend this game in its current state, I only played it a couple hours, but 60 FPS on my hardware (5800x3d & 6900XT)  at 1440p is atrocious...this is horribly optimized.\n",
      "Refunded:I played the demo of this game and decided to buy it and give it a go (since Destiny 2 was down at the time).Well, the game shows I have 88 minutes of gameplay, but that is impossible due to the game never actually launching...Then, when I would try to stop the game (From Steam App since the game never actually opened), it would just stay stuck on \"stopping\" and not even allow me to kill the process via task manager (Forspoken application) causing the game to not be able to be reopened due to it \"running\".\n",
      "While I will never get back that 3 hours I spent trying to play this game, at least I wont have to waste any more of my time on it and will receive a refund.\n",
      "game just straight up looks bad played for maybe thirty minutes and the graphics were awful looked like a 2006 sega game on gamecube honestly a huge letdown also the frames were god awful\n",
      "The combat and magic also looked good so I decided to preorder the game.\n",
      "Combat doesn't feel great, especially if you find a random area on the map that just tanks the fps.It really, REALLY, isn't worth the full price.edit: we heard you like cutscenes so we put cutscenes in your cutscenes in your cutscenes.\n",
      "Cons - The writing is bland, they freeze you in place randomly for dialog - The NPCs are the most annoying people / the bracelet talks way too much  - Bad voice acting - Characters stand still and have no emotions like robots - World is somewhat empty other than random chests to open - The crafting is really basic even though there are skills to spend mana on to craft more crafting materials - It's a bad port/is optimized poorly (running a 5900x and 3080ti, on high I run 70fps with nothing going on and ~30fps when anything is moving)  - It's does not feel like a $70 game, should be 30 or 40 - It's a short game from what I have heard - Does not at all look like what the trailers looked like - Parkour part is frustrating and okay at the best of times - Not truely open world, most of the time it will tell you that you are too far away from the objective and teleports you back not allowing you to explore - It forces you to walk super slow in some parts for \"reasons\" - Combat is boring unless it comes to the mutants, most of the time you are waiting for skills to cool down and spamming one move - The bigger enemies that aren't bosses or mutants are no threat and are just bullet spongesarmor you buy and/or find are not an upgrades at all - Magic system is also boring / the skill tree is useless and it should just unlock the spells when leveling up or using the spells - Some challenges to upgrade spells are not worded correct or are poorly wordedPros - It's not completely boring  - You'll eventually finish it and move on to a better game\n",
      "the movement doesn't feel smooth even though parkour is supposed to be a big part of this game.hopefully it will get better as i progress but i can't recommend this game to anyone rn especially when the price is this high\n",
      "Graphics were good, temperatures were not...Dialogue was a mess and cringe asf, written by an 8th grader...Story was awfully written, felt like i was watching a low budget isekai anime...Gameplay seemed promising, but i couldn't exactly enjoy it due to the aforementioned reasons.For this price and these reasons, I am refunding.I would rather play Genshin Impact.That's saying something...\n",
      "However, the premise still caught my attention.I'll start with what I like about the game.- The graphics are pretty and the animations match it's quality.- The environment is colorful and vibrant, with plenty of otherworldly sights as befitting of the setting.- Tiny tidbits of details in dialogue constantly reminds you that you are in an unfamiliar world, even if others speak the same language, the wording can be very different.And now for the things I don't like.- Combat.\n",
      "Despite the fact that I spent only an hour in the game, it accumulated things that certainly did not make that time pleasant, for example:-Graphics of this game is a joke, it looks worse than ubisoft games from like 8 years ago....-Optimization lies and withers as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, fps are low and absolutely not stable-The combat of this game, at least for this moment, was not at all fun, these powers simply as if there was no feeling.\n",
      "TLDR; Many performance issues, railroading weird decision making, lots of black screens, lots of slow walking, almost forgot dreaded walk/run faster than NPC on follow quests, wait for a big sale or for a major performance patch.I pre-ordered the deluxe edition a long time ago before the delays thinking this game would be really good.\n",
      "I have a 6900 xt and no matter what I do to the settings it seems like I can't get above 30-40 fps some of the things people are complaining about can't be fixed if you don't like the VA that's not changing also complaining about the amount of cut scenes is stupid its a Square Enix game there are always going to be a lot of cut scenes the problem is the cut scenes are low quality and lagging through them all, but being locked in place to listen to your bracelet talk you being stuck on a black screen for 30 secs can all be fixed.\n",
      "I just had to exit the game and I don't know when I will play again because I was locked on a black screen after trying to exit a menu for 3 minutes I already alt + tabbed one time to get off this I don't know if it actually did anything, but after I had to go in and change my settings from windowed back to full screen which is a minor annoyance I know but isn't something I should have to do for simply exiting a menu to look at upgrades or after being forced to look at the archive without any warning.\n",
      "Here's a few things about this game:- For a \"next gen\" game, this sure doesn't look or \"feel\" like next get to me.\n",
      "I understand that it is plagued by this Break, however, whatever video materials you are going to watch, they do not reflect the true state of things within the game.- No memorable characters, sorry.- Dialogues are cringe and voice acting is not the best.I can't, in good faith, recommend buying this game at full price to anyone.PS: I think this title is a very good example of everything that's wrong with the industry these days.\n",
      "I liked the game in the first 3 hours, after that it just got repetitive.\n",
      "Granted, I am the player that likes to explore the areas that I'm given access to as fully as I can and I honestly don't mind grinding out levels and experiences gauges on skills because I play a ton of JRPGs. However, combat is literally the only thing in the game.\n",
      "The combat in this game is frustrating because Frey moves around like an uncontrolled tornado when you use Parkour (her main thing).\n",
      "The game has both good and bad aspects, but overall I will rate it 5/10.There is a huge open world to explore consisting of continuous copy and paste elements.\n",
      "if you can buy it in years time when it's like 10$ or something and they actually fixed all of the bugs then I would say get it if you are bored and there is nothing else to play.\n",
      "Bought the game, Half of the textures don't load or don't want to even try, Fps issues with a 3070ti, The Body and voice acting feels like they're on a budget or just couldn't be asked (i played up to the point i can use magic and run around) the magic is well deigned so +1 for that, When they do fix the textures and FPS issues, I'm sure this would be a great experience (belongs you can stand the ignorance from the main character) Just like nearly every other triple A company, They directly import it from console so it fails rather than taking an extra month to make sure it's done correctly, Product refunded and i will wait 6-18 months before thinking about getting it again when it's fixed, I don't recommend this game in it's current state, Save your money and try again later!\n",
      "At its best Forspoken is a Ubisoft style open world game with good traversal mechanics, however it feels as if it was rushed out the door.\n",
      "Other than funneling you through the main story the game leaves it up to you to decide how much you want to engage with a really ugly and dead world.\n",
      "By the end game there were whole regions on the map I never went to because the story never takes you there and there is no reason to go unless you want to clear out more map icons.Once you unlock your full parkour abilities you can run really fast and that feels satisfying but climbing is a huge hassle.\n",
      "Square Enix, this is not good and for only 1 hour was i even having fun playing this game; do better.\n",
      "After the 1.10 update the game works way better, at least it's playeable, but it still has so many things to optimize and I can't recommend the game on its current state at this price.\n",
      "Wait for sales and/or future patches unless you really want to play the game now.\n",
      "bruh what the ♥♥♥♥ did ya'll test this game on, makes sense no one got PC review copies, what the ♥♥♥♥ is this bruh, movement is so stuttery, and why does it use so much VRAM when the graphics look like late ps3 era games, i get 120 fps everywhere constantly till i'm outdoors, and then i can barely get constant frames, on a 3080Ti and an i9 10th gen, what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on cuh, 90 canadian dollars for this?\n",
      "Welp I decided to try it even with all the negative stigma around the game needless to say i refunded it within 40mins of gameplay its a 20 dollar game at best it also runs like crap on pc boring dialog way too may cutscenes main character is awful imo but the combat is pretty good and the concept around the game is cool like i said if this was a 20 dollar game id keep it in my library but the fact i paid more for this than elden ring makes me sick\n",
      "I can't write on the atmosphere and world itself due to my FPS issues and me needing to use the lowest of low settings to just be able to play a bit.\n",
      "My System is able to play a lot of titles on high or at least standard graphic settings which means this game should have more FPS on the lowest of settings.\n",
      "very very bad, the game is only like 10 hours long and it cost 70 (imo i like the dollar an hour rule with exceptions) the story isn't that interesting, the lore seems good but i havn't looked into it much, the combat is \"cool\" but pretty basic after 5 minutes and repetitive, and the voice acting, omg is it awful, there are so many awkward silences that arn't filled in, and the main character is so mean for literally no reason at all with no redemption arc or anything (which is usually really cool in games), why play the game when you hate the person your playing as, the cuff is funny, but whenever he says anything frey makes fun of him or tells him to stop talking, for no reason at all whatsoever, and the \"open world\" is just a bunch of nothing and a total of like 4 enemy types (which games have unfortunately been doing recently), the parkour is kinda fun, not really any problems with that, would maybe play for 20 dollars max but no more definitely less.\n",
      "Story played through, wouldn't have lasted a minute more.Bad WritingWorst optimization since Stranger of ParadiseStory way too short for 80€Graphics much worse than in the trailerIf you like to go through a PS3 world with low FPS, this is your game.I do not recommend it.\n",
      "On a fresh start up of the game, it runs smooth as butter but over time it stutters and drops frames that progressively gets worse until it crashes.\n",
      "To be clear, I can not say anything about Forspoken's gameplay, and little about the actual game itself besides that the first bit of the first cut-scene looks decent.\n",
      "Such a shame it isn't, the lore of the world is really good, I enjoyed a lot everything related to that, the voice acting is not that bad as people are saying overall if you judge this game as an Action-Adventure game it's a solid 8 or even 9 out of 10.\n",
      "What I mean by this is the world they created, the roles of the council, the backstory and how the world works.- This one will be controversial but I enjoyed A LOT the talking between Frey and Cuff, and I even changed the settings for maximum content on that, but that's me, one of my favorite part of Cyberpunk is when you get Skippy and he talks to you, I can honestly say they talking is a big reason for me to keep playing.- The magic and parkour, feels really nice and different, you can see that they worked on it, it's different from other games at least from my experience.Now the bad:- There's absolute NO CHOICE in this game, at least up to this point, I don't know if this was made clear prior to the release but for me, an RPG consists of having CHOICES, even dialogue choices matter, that's the roleplaying part, you can have more hardcore RPG like Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age or you can get RPGActions like Witcher, but they DO have CHOICES, and this one doesn't even have dialogue options, I think God of War had more than it, this wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't considered itself an RPG as I would see it as a \"playable movie\".\n",
      "Bear in mind that I'm not close to the endgame so MAYBE there will be some kind of choices further down.- There are some times that you are talking with Cuff and you are just there frozen while speaking, you can't walk and speak at the same time, god knows why.- Lots of times where the cutscene just fades out and then it fast forward, sometimes just a couple seconds or minutes, sometimes are longer, feels unnatural.- It seems the main story has only ~8 hours, while the full game has 17-20 hours and you can make it bigger if you explore A LOT, I don't see how that fits well with an RPG, I mean we definitely have some RPGs that has short hours but not this short, ME 1 has 17 hours of main story at least plus ~12 of sides.- Gear and upgrading skills seems pretty simple, no complexity whatsoever and I wouldn't be surprise if this is a kind of game that you can have all the skills unlocked without have to choose, after all NO CHOICES, right?- The game does feel like it's a port in some areasI will play the full game as I am enjoying the parts that I mentioned, but I don't feel like I'm playing an RPG not even an RPGA, feels \"better\" if you look into it like you are playing Marvel's Spider-man, I would NEVER in my right mind say this is worth what they are asking $$ and I can't recommend it with so many downsides from what was promised, if you read this and still thinks this will be for you and it has some discount right now or you have lots of money to spend then go for it you may enjoy it.Tech tip: If you are using an AMD GPU I would suggest turning off FSR 2.0 for some reason there's almost no impact in the FPS itself and generates stuttering in custscenes (I'm usign a 6800 XT).\n",
      "Magic is the only spectacular visual in this game, and it's not like you are focusing on it while fighting enemies.The story elements are predictable and very cliche.\n",
      "When you start running, more spawn to give an element of fear, but I searched as I moved forward to avoid them, and it showed me them all.This game is a rushed story that feels like it was put together with tape and cliche-glue.\n",
      "In the normal game they look alright.The prologue seems really under developed area wise, but honestly I didn't care much there since you're only there for a little bit.Hopefully it'll get patch fixed soon so it's a bit more playable, because the combat is really fun and has a ton of potential.\n",
      "not worth, game has so many cutscenes that you can do nothing but watch, combat looks nice but the only fun is from unlocking new skills, upgrades dun really make a noticable difference for items and skills.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong....I do want to play more of this game....just not for this price.\n",
      "If you wanted to watch an interactive movie rather than actually play a game maybe this is for you?\n",
      "Your trying to just leave the city to get back to game play and get constantly interrupted with pointless cut scenes.\n",
      "The game play itself is a lot of fun, but the developers sure try hard to keep you away from it.\n",
      "Poor game-play, unlikable characters, predictable story.\n",
      "This game is almost unplayable, even in very low settings the game is still lagging- Too Expensive- Bad Performance needed to be optimized - Combat is somewhat clunky - Movements is 7/10 it's good but sometimes hard to maneuver - Dialogue is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Very bad looking skies- World looks boring pale and empty- Voice acting is 4/10 - Get A Refund and wait for sale\n",
      "This is supposed to be next gen only (current gen) the game is horrific the only thing that feels good is the combat but you rarely are able to do that because of all the cut scenes prob the worst game ive played for cut scenes its so bad i broke my controller in half yeah its that annoying and dont even try playing with keyboard and mouse its very clunky.The voice acting and character models are horrible not to mention the shadows the game looks 10 years old.Performance sucks as well even with a 12900k,64gb ddr4 4000 and 3080ti at 4k max setings dlss on quality i get frame drops into the 60s turn on raytracing and fps goes to 40s also alot of stutters and im pretty sure there is a memory leak.If your thinking of getting this game wait until its like $5 people on ps5 that paid $70 id get a refund\n",
      "/ 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☐ 6☑ 7☐ 8☐ 9☐ 10I refunded the game on PC because it was just not worth trying to play with the horrid optimization in its current state, therefore I am only marking it as Not Recommended because of this.\n",
      "The optimization problems also string over to console, with noticeable FPS drops during some fights or in certain areas of the game.Other than that, the story seems pretty good in my opinion.\n",
      "I really want to like this game, as it is fun mechanically, but the requirements to get the game to look OK and actually play smoothly are too high for my liking.\n",
      "Next off the dialogue in this game is horrendous the main character is so black and white, nice and forgiving, and then a complete jerk all the sudden in other situations she is completely the most unrelatable narrator of any story I have ever experienced, like I really hate her.\n",
      "They feel almost like a last minute addition to the game so much that I stopped even trying to play them after just two detours.\n",
      "Now all things aside like I said I had some fun moments with this game but the game to me just wasn't all what I wanted it to be, maybe if I played through the whole game I would enjoy it more but I find the game unplayable right now so I will try again when they fix more of the bugs that caused me trouble while playing.\n",
      "Gameplay was great, parkour felt like a levelled up version of Assassins Creed's parkour, combat felt good early on even with having limited tools to play around with, the skill trees make it seem like it gets more interesting as the game goes on.\n",
      "My computer can run pretty much every game from the last few years at high visuals with no issue, but the frame-rates on this dipped to sub 30 often on low graphics.\n",
      "this game is so ♥♥♥♥ - graphics look ass and super buggy, my game crashed 3 times before i even got to the tutorial and i had to sit through 20 minutes of cut scenes before i could even play the game despite the fact that i skipped at every possible point,\n",
      "- Crashed too much at the beginning - I've have been lagged out a lot too- 96 SGD for this kind of optimization...im sorry its totally not worth the price- i will give it a chance after few patches its still the same i will consider a refund on this ♥♥♥♥.- game overall its great but optimization its worse then i know.\n",
      "I'm a 3070 Ti running game on lowest settings + 78% render res-poorly optimised for PC-frequent cut scenes that feel intrusive and take away from the player experience rather than add to it-flow feels clunky and if it wasn't for the frequent frame stutters and holding you in air preventing you from dodging due to flow path-finding thinking a rock a valid reason to launch 10ft in the air right into dragons fire breath would probably feel pretty goodOverall good idea poor execution not worth getting until they sort out optimisation- the experience isn't worth the hassle.\n",
      "After 3-4 hours:The amount of missed potential and bad UX is just sad.After finishing the whole thing:First off, DO NOT BUY UNLESS ITS AT A DEEP DISCOUNT!To go in to detail, this game makes me sad.\n",
      "Sadly it fails to deliver on all levels.The systems are not well explained, took me a good few hours to figure out that \"Purple magic\" refers to my brown earth/pebble magic, not just my signature spell, and these sort of issues keep popping up.As for the gameplay, moving around is a lot of fun, and you get pretty fast early on in the game with specific movement abilities locked behind activities you have to travel to and do.\n",
      "Sure, a part of it is that this is a multi-platform game, but some of it is just bad, no matter if your playing on console or PC.Speaking of UX, I don't know if there's a technical reason, or just sheer \"I don't give a s@#$!\" but taking away user control during in world conversations is just stupid.\n",
      "The pacing is bad, they have a real issue with the \"show not tell\" concept, especially since in video games its always better to \"let them play it instead of showing it\".\n",
      "The sad part is that I actually enjoyed what I did play and want to see this game through from beginning to end, but until they release a patch which optimizes the game it's virtually unplayable even on the best of hardware.\n",
      "I think this game is getting a lot of heat for bad dialogue, but honestly I think it's quirky, enjoyable, and laughable in a good way at times if it were executed better by better voice actors and better cinematic cut scenes to help cast the scene.\n",
      "Very cringe characters and intro story, so I was looking forward to the combat gameplay, but as soon as I started trying the combat it would have insane frame drops, I'm talking about going from 120 fps down to 4-5 fps even on the lowest settings possible.\n",
      "If you can run the game, system requirements are a bit insane, and you dont care at all about story then you might enjoy the combat.As someone who prefers both I had to ask for my money back.\n",
      "Even the map is sluggish to load, which isn't great for an open world game.- Even good dialogue gets annoying when the same dozen specific lines are used for actions you'll perform hundreds of times.\n",
      "(Cuff, you should know I don't like exercise by now...)Wait for the above issues being fixed, and even then, I'd suggest waiting for a significant sale.Some positives:+ The story has both mystery, fantasy, and a gritty attitude to it.+ The main character has a lot of attitude and provides a connection between being grounded in our world and dealing with the magical.+ While there are some NPCs with poor writing and/or acting — there are also a few fun ones.+ The combat system allows different styles of play to be viable and funStory: 7/10Characters: 6/10Gameplay: 7/10Visuals: 6/10 (7 on highest - a significant performance hit)Performance: 4/10\n",
      "after playing for 24hr straight main story i am very disappointed with the game i face so many issue thu , to avoid spoiler there is an event where everyone gather and what happen in the graphic its a joke its like some pages flipping and when the MC talking the motion mouth its F funny how the hell they release this game and dialog between characters its like some Disney chat is this Square game ?\n",
      "Bad writing, bad game play, bad graphics, bad optimization...\n",
      "I dont like leaving bad reviews but this game is unplayable and a waste of $65.\n",
      "MC is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the game itself runs like ♥♥♥♥ between all the bugs and the insane RECOMMENDED requirements.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this game, and have a fun action rpg lite experience leading up to the release of Hogwarts Legacy (GOTY 2023 easy).Sadly this game had almost no fun in the time I could play.\n",
      "Also not sure why they force you to play as a female protagonist with all the other games coming out like this allowing man/woman choice.\n",
      "the game looks ♥♥♥♥ and the main character is cringe\n",
      "- Story feels forced- Game is horribly optemised - graphics are not up to 2023 standards - 80 EURO PRICE TAG?!\n",
      "This game came free with my GPU and I still feel like I got ripped off.\n",
      "Pros-Fun parkour and exciting combat when the game finally opens up towards the end.\n",
      "Received this game for free with a promotion from AMD and I still feel like I got ripped off.\n",
      "Game play is pretty fun, though I feel like they missed out with not allowing you to combine the different skill trees in any way.\n",
      "If you set to ultra, it looks like low from a next-gen game.Voice acting is so terrible, so annoying, and so unoriginal.\n",
      "In cutscenes for some reason FPS can drop to 10...even on one that had 4 character models in a dark alley...no idea why that would cause huge fps drops.Theres lighting problems with lighting turning off and back on or flickering and popping in and out, fps spiking and other glitches.The gameplay itself seems fine and the story is mediocre, the voice acting is pretty good as long as you tell cuff to stfu.Would I recommend this game right now?\n",
      "Probably.It's a shame steam doesnt have like a mediocre option that is neither YES or NO but just MAYBE.Play the demo, see if it even runs on your system, or wait for some patches to fix a lot of this stuff I am sure in the coming weeks.\n",
      "The dialogue is Marvel tier, the story looks like it was made for children and the game play is flashy but shallow.\n",
      "I didnt like it , its actually a good looking game but the story how it begins ,first time using powers etc ,im disappointed..\n",
      "Btw if you think this game is good look at the trailer that says:Keyboard & mouse or controler inputSmooth performance : xD from 120 fps to 50 on RTX 3070 I cant stand hearing character saying \"♥♥♥♥\" and \"♥♥♥♥\" over and over again (script 10/10)When your bracelet talks to you you cant move at allThis is the first game i refund after 30 minutes op playing.Maybe get it on 75% sale.\n",
      "EDIT: Refunded at 2.5 hours, even steam knows this game is trash2 hrs in, and so far the voice acting isn't bad, but it's flat.Prologue is about 2 hrs so decide if you want a refund before then.Combat is fun and has potential, Graphics are atrocious.Random pop-ins, really bad texturing and at some points, models around the clothes on my character are just flickering in and out.The best of the graphical errors are running this game at 60 fps and watching NPCs moving at 10 FPS.Would be a fun game with very little guilt without the 70 dollar price point, but this is a damn shame to see Square pull another sheisty release.\n",
      "so many unnecessary cut scene, the ui is so clunky, the dialogue is meh, should not cost this much for people to play this game.\n",
      "20 hours later into this and it's such a shame, the game had so much potential and that main character makes it so painful to get interested in it.A quick google search shows Luminous Productions made  Final Fantasy XV, and that explains a lot about how this game looks and feels.\n",
      "I cannot develop any connection to my character when they behave like this one does.I have never walked away from a cutscene in a new game but this was the first time where I couldn't have cared less about the dialog between her and her arm partner \"Cuff\".\n",
      "Played through story and did most of the side content because I did found the world was fun to traverse.I'm do not know why some people claimed this game is woke as they never tell the reason, I did not run into any woke subjects matter on my 50 hours play-through and I have not known any Japan game developer that involve woke stuff into their games.The game is a 6 out of 10 at best due the terrible story writing, interesting enemies are far too few , combat takes too long to get good and sadly when it does get interesting the enemies becomes too easy.\n",
      "Could have been better if they at least have those 3 things right.Buy it only if its heavily discounted and if you like fast open world traversal.\n",
      "Game base :80Story :20 (my personal feel about the way they talk and their answer.\n",
      "-120good: no bugs, skill is cool(but have to go through that stupid story to use that skill, it cause me dont want to continue play the game after finish the mainstory and got all skill.).\n",
      "I like my games to look the best whenever possible so this bothered me quite a bit.\n",
      "the looks do get better in the open world but not alot.so the worst part of the game is 50% or so of the story mode that is close to a cut-seen plays like an early 2000s game feels weird and sometimes you arent aloud to move your screen bc it is locked in place.\n",
      "i can see why the game is mixed right now its 100% not worth 70$ maybe 50$ if that its a fun game with lackluster looks and story movement.\n",
      "-Switching Spells In Combat Is Done Horribly-Parkour System (When It Does Not Work)-Extremely Poor Pacing-Performance Issues-Zero Likable Characters-Needs 122 Gigs-Bad Story-Lifeless, Awkward NPCs-Can't See Combat If You Cast Your Spells-Annoying, Repetitive Dialogue-Empty World-Repetitive Tasks-High Price -Square Enix-Capitalizing Every Word\n",
      "I honestly don't know why people are so hard on this Isekai game, the game play is fun as well as engaging and the main character I personally found to be highly relatable.\n",
      "First of all I got this with a GPU i bought last year so I didn't go out my way to buy this game, that being said would I personally go out and buy this game now?...No.It's not a terrible game far from it, its got issues, lets start with the pausing and being unable to move while you talk to your mystical bracelet 'Cuff' I have no idea why this is a thing you are fixed and unable to move until you finish the dialog its annoying and I cannot see why you cant run about while the conversation is happening?Controls are okay could be better, the combat is good and awkward at the same time because of how they have setup the combat mechanics/controls once you get used to it you're flipping and shooting all over the place with some really nice visuals to go alongside it.Visuals, I don't know about this one because sometimes it looks great then other times it looks mediocre at best, I'm playing it on high settings which is one down from maxed out and ray tracing turned off (it really doesn't look any different on or off) and performance wise it runs around 75-80 fps it needs some serious optimising to increase that fps considering they delayed the game from last year too its pretty poor performance wise.Game-play is fun for the most part, combat is visually nice combat with loads of particle effects and flashy colours and explosions lol, A.I. are dumb AF though they just seem to group up slowly and then pounce/attack you which is easily avoidable by holding down a button and moving left and right.\n",
      "In the beginning I didn't get the bad reviews, given it was out only a couple of days at the time.Now that I've put some time in I feel the need to give this a resounding thumbs down.Graphically this game is prettyGameplay is great once all the magic and abilities are unlocked.best to stick to the story 1st playthru as there's lots to explore later.\n",
      "Some people will say that you have a lot of point of interest, but is feels very random and empty.However, aside from these major issues (which force me to give a negative review), the game was pleasant and the demo does not do justice to the full game because after the first boss you get another set of magic which considerably make the gameplay funnnier and better.\n",
      "Indeed, playing this game is fun and quite original, miles better than Hogwarts which feels more generic gameplay-wise.\n",
      "Performance is not great stutters and is choppy, story itself pretty bland cut scenes take forever to load doesn't look great either at some points games graphics are mediocre, I did receive the game for free from AMD really the only nice thing about it.\n",
      "I didnt pay $70 for a movie like game, I bought an open world parkour magic combat game and i wanna play it ..\n",
      "Just wait until the price goes down to €20 or whatever you feel like a game might be worth.The good part is the fun movement and combat.\n",
      "Enemies respawn after a while, so whatever you do never feels like you accomplished something.In summary, the game is neither worth  your time nor your money unless you love cats and Tamagotchis.\n",
      "Literal PS2 graphics running somewhere from 20-60fps bouncing all over the place on Low settings 1440p on an RTX 2060 WITH DLSS.The magic gameplay seems fun so far, but the folks that made this just don't know a thing about graphics.\n",
      "Yaiks after 10 minuts i just saw that games in 2013 were looking better and they were working better!!!soo trash not a worth even for free!!!2023 starts good with another disappointments!!!don't buy not worth it waste of money and your time!!!\n",
      "Like in the year 2023 there is an open world game with no time of day cycle.\n",
      "So the mechanic is in the game but for some reason during combat is like right up Frey's backside.\n",
      "That is why it was free with my AMD Radeon 6600 because they want to make sure that people play games that take more resources so that everyone has to buy better hardware, (word of mouth) so to speak.Another point I would like to mention is the eye cannot see more than 60fps on average so it is actually pointless to set it to anything higher than that, with that said yes higher frame rates (internally) help due to the possibility of lost packets sent to the monitor but what is actually delivered to the screen only needs to be 60fps for you to have a smooth experience, that is not to say that companies do not lie about the frame rates but ultimately all you can possibly see with a human eye is 60 fps.\n",
      "The reason you see jitter at times at 60fps could potentially be dropped packets sent to the monitor and poor programming in the buffer region of the video card your using.planned obsolescence is all I can really say here about this game while I have a powerful computer I don't like that people that cannot afford the latest greatest will not be able to play something at such a high cost.\n",
      "I didnt pay $70 for a movie like game, I bought an open world parkour magic combat game and i wanna play it darnit.\n",
      "Hopefully they will fix it in a few patches, but for now it's too annoying for me to play more of this.In general, I like the combat.\n",
      "Combat looks good and for the most part, is probably the best thing this game has to offer.\n",
      "The best part of this game is the story, and that's if you ignore the horrible main protagonist you play as, Alfre \"Frey\" Holland.\n",
      "But for me the unforgivable thing was how many times they took you out of game play for no reason whatsoever.\n",
      "Good story that could have been great if the main character was better written.\n",
      "I do recommend you wait for a sale because i dont thinks its worth $70, but its a fun game.\n",
      "The dialogue isnt as bad as a lot of people are saying either.update: after last story bossPC requirements are crazy though, game ran fine till last chapter boss fight.\n",
      "I have played an hour at most of this game as the game had audio and graphics issues when it did load.\n",
      "\"Fun at times, \"wish the narrative wasn't so bland\", \"waste of potential\" were some of the thoughts I often had during my playthrough of Forspoken and while I didn't think the game itself is an unmitigated disaster some of the reviews make it sound like, even at best it was simply a mediocre open world game that suffers from poor design decisions, bland story with unlikable characters and a PC port that is riddled with myriad of bugs and various technical issues.Sometimes you play games where certain elements of the game carry the playthrough even if you actively dislike the others, such was the case with Forspoken and for me it was the traversal and combat systems which I found quite enjoyable even if a little janky at times.\n",
      "But on the other hand once you start to look around more closely it all starts to feel very similar and the R, G or B color filter depending on the area did not really help on making a good impression.One particular gripe I also had throughout the game was the main story structure/pacing which constantly tries to wrestle your control away: Brief cutscenes, small fade to black interruptions, quest title cards, forced dialogues where you cannot move, awkward transitions that take a little too long and make you wonder if something glitched out as you can't move...\n",
      "While there are some \"cringy\" lines or quips here and there, honestly I felt like they weren't that frequent and ultimately didn't really bother me too much.In some ways this character writing reminded me a little of the issue a lot of people had with Days Gone where the main character was unlikable at the start of the game and while it ultimately paid off if you stuck with the game many never got quite that far.\n",
      "The movement and game play were loads of fun but the story was horrible.\n",
      "(Had the game litteraly yank me out of areas cause I was too early or something, open world my ass)  But my main gripe with the game, is the story, the lack of dialogue differences (you will hear the same lines 20+times likely), and my most annoying one, story pacing.\n",
      "however this game on the lowest settings possible im running 70fps, and it looks like garbage.\n",
      "thats all i have to say for now lmaoo but if you just play just for fun and just to take your mind of things this is a good game.\n",
      "don't buy it until at least 10 patches, the game is so poorly unoptimized, i have a ryzen 9 5900X and rtx 3080 and the game struggles with even loading in textures, i struggle to get stable 60 fps playing in 4k low settings\n",
      "I don't like it at all, really poor game-play and a slow terrible story, really didn't enjoy it\n",
      "Having a lot of fun, but the game doesn't look good enough to warrant the poor performance.\n",
      "The worst looking game i ever played.\n",
      "Its not too bad story wise but the voice acting is a bit rough and I felt like out of the nearly 2 hours there was maybe 10 minutes of actual play the rest I spent cleaning up around the house listening to the game play itself in cutscenes.\n",
      "The game looks and feels like a PS3 game, combat is clunky, story is uninspired and downright goofy at times, etc.\n",
      "Glad I got it for free because its not worth the price in its current state.-Graphics are nothing like the trailer.-Keyboard controls are clunky.-No HDR calibration image.-Capped frame rate.-Boring game-play and dialogue.Preforms okay on my setup ~60fps high settings with some stuttering, 5800x, 6800xt on a 4k monitor.It would have been more engaging if the game-play describes the scenes rather than Frey narrating so much as this makes the game very boring.\n",
      "The state the game is in, I can not recommend buying it for full price.Unless they deliver some really good patches soon, wait for a 50% sale.Optimization is terrible and graphics are not on the same level as Horizon or God of War.However the soundtrack is, as can be expected from Square, very good as usual.The combat is fun but gets repetetive fast, the story is decent, but terribly executed.The main char is charming in her own way but felt kinda rushed.All in all, this game feels very unpolished (in every aspect) and more like an indie title.However if Luminous learns anything from this, their next game has the potential to be amazing.\n",
      "I feel conflicted about reviewing a game only 30 mins after playing it but the performance is unacceptable for a triple A title.\n",
      "This game is realy not worth the money,  I got a refund after playing through the first 2 chapters.\n",
      "There are also points in the game so far where it feels like you should be able to move but your character is locked b/c the game is just loading but it doesnt tell you its doing so.\n",
      "This game has potential, initial impressions from the first hour of gameplay, the intro dialogue from Ch1 does feel a little forced and stiff, but the story itself alongside the combat, magic and worldbuilding make it interesting enough to want to continue.\n",
      "The game play is okay at best for now only reason I say that is because the parkour aspect of the game looks amazing how ever the fighting is very repetitive all monsters have only like 4-5 moves tops which they all repeat even bosses when they are low health.\n",
      "Fix/optimize this game, and release something that doesn't feel like a marketing gimmick.\n",
      "Got this free with an AMD card.The performance is egregiously bad (especially since the game mostly doesn’t even look that good) and desperately needs a patch.\n",
      "Some things are actually pretty great (combat and traversal) while others are just plain bad (dialogue, story, enemy variety and design).\n",
      "Right now, with a pretty competent 4K (high refresh) native gaming setup, I'm getting 45 fps on a game that looks like it was made 6-7 years ago rather than for a 2023 release.\n",
      "It'd be one thing if it was just banter in the background as I play, but to lock me into a place and force me to interact with a story through dialogue that feels pretty bad to listen to and I just could do it.\n",
      "Couldn't even get the opening cutscene to finish playing before the game crashed.\n",
      "My review so far with my limited time in the game, to be updated as I play through it.\n",
      "I hope to add more to the like column as time goes on, but for now this is a wait and see how they improve the game/sale.\n",
      "I'm sure the actual game, combat and traversal is probably fun but I honestly couldn't even get to the 2 hour limit without getting annoyed.\n",
      "Summary: The game to me feels like you had a group of developers, some that was really good and some that where bad.\n",
      "-The game tries to make you feel sorry for the main character, but she seems to just be a ♥♥♥♥.\n",
      "is it just me or does the game kinda looks like a bad/unoptimised version of elden ring?\n",
      "its not the worst game ever or even a bad one but sure not worth 70-dollaroonies.noticed my play time was well under 2 hours..\n",
      "EDIT: after playing for some time, while the gameplay definitely carried the entire game, its currently pretty faulty on RDNA 2 AMD gpus.\n",
      "Just feels like I am forced to stand still too much and it takes away from the feeling of this being an open world game focused on cool movement.Meanwhile, I can play Assassins creed Valhalla on high graphics and it feels and looks waaaaay better and smoother than this.I can NOT for the life of me recommend this game for the 80 Euro pricetag.\n",
      "played a couple hours and have yet to actually have full control of my character or see the world\n",
      "I have a fully built gaming PC that's just a few years old and it can hardly run this unless I want the game/graphics to look like it was made in the 1990's.\n",
      "It looks good, I am sure the combat and movement would feel amazing with at least the recommended rig, but for me with an average pc this game does not run well enough.\n"

       " 'summary of why this game is bad and you shouldn\\'t be playing it, based on my first impression:- expensive- cringey lines- unpolished in almost every aspect (i got a 3090 and i can only get ~60-80 fps maxed out settings @ 1080p with dlss, even dl2 isn\\'t this bad while also looking better and having more things going on than this game)- a lot of the game features felt unfinished (it feels like comparing the cinematic justice league vs snyder cut, that\\'s the best comparison i could come up with, this game feels like something that should\\'ve had more, yet someone on the company was like \"that\\'s too long, make it shorter and more compact, cut this and that out, change that to this, etc\")- did i mention that it cost a lot?- some unseemingly bad game/story design (imo)- bad facial animation (it looks really jarring in at least like 1/3 of the scenes i\\'ve seen)- bad voice acting in some parts (a lot of tone miss / monotones in the wrong time)- awkward silences every now and then, it\\'s like i\\'m watching a skyrim conversation for a sec...- pricesimple example of why it\\'s bad:the first 1.5h or so, are basically interactive cutscenes, the amount of time this game stops you and show you an uncontrollable scene is astonishing, you watch minutes of cutscenes, walk couple steps, or run a block or two, and then met with another cutscenes, maybe even accompanied with a loading screen, rinse and repeat...\\nchopped into bits and pieces here and there due to the innumerable amount of cutscenes?the magic combat was good, nothing amazing (at least on my experience, i didn\\'t play much to unlock everything after all), the animation transition, especially from flow to opening doors / chests are really jarring, it\\'s like they\\'re trying to copy witcher 3 ballet-like movement principle (how geralt\\'s combat animation was based on dancing) on it, when you press the interact button the character would loop to the door and then loop the other way to kick the stuff open, which is...\\n- parkour is fun and flashy but can be annoying at times.- cuff is actually a good character.',\n",
       " 'such a shame it isn\\'t, the lore of the world is really good, i enjoyed a lot everything related to that, the voice acting is not that bad as people are saying overall if you judge this game as an action-adventure game it\\'s a solid 8 or even 9 out of 10.\\nwhat i mean by this is the world they created, the roles of the council, the backstory and how the world works.- this one will be controversial but i enjoyed a lot the talking between frey and cuff, and i even changed the settings for maximum content on that, but that\\'s me, one of my favorite part of cyberpunk is when you get skippy and he talks to you, i can honestly say they talking is a big reason for me to keep playing.- the magic and parkour, feels really nice and different, you can see that they worked on it, it\\'s different from other games at least from my experience.now the bad:- there\\'s absolute no choice in this game, at least up to this point, i don\\'t know if this was made clear prior to the release but for me, an rpg consists of having choices, even dialogue choices matter, that\\'s the roleplaying part, you can have more hardcore rpg like baldur\\'s gate or dragon age or you can get rpgactions like witcher, but they do have choices, and this one doesn\\'t even have dialogue options, i think god of war had more than it, this wouldn\\'t be a problem if the game didn\\'t considered itself an rpg as i would see it as a \"playable movie\".']"

       "['cons - the writing is bland, they freeze you in place randomly for dialog - the npcs are the most annoying people / the bracelet talks way too much  - bad voice acting - characters stand still and have no emotions like robots - world is somewhat empty other than random chests to open - the crafting is really basic even though there are skills to spend mana on to craft more crafting materials - it\\'s a bad port/is optimized poorly (running a 5900x and 3080ti, on high i run 70fps with nothing going on and ~30fps when anything is moving)  - it\\'s does not feel like a $70 game, should be 30 or 40 - it\\'s a short game from what i have heard - does not at all look like what the trailers looked like - parkour part is frustrating and okay at the best of times - not truely open world, most of the time it will tell you that you are too far away from the objective and teleports you back not allowing you to explore - it forces you to walk super slow in some parts for \"reasons\" - combat is boring unless it comes to the mutants, most of the time you are waiting for skills to cool down and spamming one move - the bigger enemies that aren\\'t bosses or mutants are no threat and are just bullet spongesarmor you buy and/or find are not an upgrades at all - magic system is also boring / the skill tree is useless and it should just unlock the spells when leveling up or using the spells - some challenges to upgrade spells are not worded correct or are poorly wordedpros - it\\'s not completely boring  - you\\'ll eventually finish it and move on to a better game\\nthe movement doesn\\'t feel smooth even though parkour is supposed to be a big part of this game.hopefully it will get better as i progress but i can\\'t recommend this game to anyone rn especially when the price is this high\\ngraphics were good, temperatures were not...dialogue was a mess and cringe asf, written by an 8th grader...story was awfully written, felt like i was watching a low budget isekai anime...gameplay seemed promising, but i couldn\\'t exactly enjoy it due to the aforementioned reasons.for this price and these reasons, i am refunding.i would rather play genshin impact.that\\'s saying something...\\nhowever, the premise still caught my attention.i\\'ll start with what i like about the game.- the graphics are pretty and the animations match it\\'s quality.- the environment is colorful and vibrant, with plenty of otherworldly sights as befitting of the setting.- tiny tidbits of details in dialogue constantly reminds you that you are in an unfamiliar world, even if others speak the same language, the wording can be very different.and now for the things i don\\'t like.- combat.']"
