In the entertainment industry, the gaming sector has established itself as a prominent player (Newzoo, 2023). As game development and releases grow, it has become increasingly crucial for developers and publishers to comprehend the factors and decisions that contribute to a game's triumph. The present study endeavors to explore the feasibility of classifying games into distinct success levels based on their number of owners, positive ratings, and average playtime as features. These factors are believed to be strong indicators of a game's popularity and overall success. Other than measurements of success, the dataset contains several potential features that may contribute to high ownership which will be explored.
